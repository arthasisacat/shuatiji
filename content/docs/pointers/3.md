## Description
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Solution

sliding window, i points to the start of candidate string, j is moving to right every time. If `cnt[s[j]] > 1`, keep moving i to right (by incresing i , and decrement `cnt[s[i]]`) until `cnt[s[j]]` no longer breaks the rule.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_map<char,int> cnt;
        int i = 0, res = 0;
        for(int j = 0; j < s.size(); j++){
            cnt[s[j]]++;
            while(cnt[s[j]] > 1){
                cnt[s[i]]--;
                i++;
            }
            res = max(res, j-i+1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
