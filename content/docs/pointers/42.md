# 42. Trapping Rain Water
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   

## Description
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. Thanks Marcos for contributing this image!

Example:
```
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```
## Solution 2 pointer version, hard to understand

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int max_l = 0;
        int max_r = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = height.size() - 1;
        int res = 0;
        while (l <= r) { // or l <= r?
            if (height[l] <= height[r]) {
                if (height[l] >= max_l) {
                    max_l = height[l];
                }
                else {
                    res += max_l - height[l];
                }
                l++;
            }
            else {
                if (height[r] >= max_r) {
                    max_r = height[r];
                }
                else {
                    res += max_r - height[r];
                }
                r--;
            }            
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2: 2 passes, easier to understand
from [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/discuss/17357/Sharing-my-simple-c%2B%2B-code%3A-O(n)-time-O(1)-space)

I think this one is easier
```c++
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height.length < 3) return 0;
        int tallest = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < height.length; i++)
            if (height[tallest] < height[i]) tallest = i;
        
        int water = 0;
        for (int i = 0, tall = 0; i < tallest; i++) {
            if (tall < height[i]) tall = height[i];
            else water += tall - height[i];
        }
        for (int i = height.length - 1, tall = 0; i > tallest; i--) {
            if (tall < height[i]) tall = height[i];
            else water += tall - height[i];
        }
        return water;
    }
```
