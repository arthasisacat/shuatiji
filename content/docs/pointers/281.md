# 281. Zigzag Iterator
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-iterator/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   


## Description
Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.
Example:
Input:
v1 = [1,2]
v2 = [3,4,5,6] 

Output: [1,3,2,4,5,6]

Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,3,2,4,5,6].
Follow up: What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?
Clarification for the follow up question:
The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for k > 2 cases. If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic". For example:
Input:
[1,2,3]
[4,5,6,7]
[8,9]

Output: [1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7].

## Solution
```c++
class ZigzagIterator {
private:
    vector<int> arr;
    int p = 0;
public:
    ZigzagIterator(vector<int>& v1, vector<int>& v2) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < v1.size() && j < v2.size()){
            arr.push_back(v1[i++]);
            arr.push_back(v2[j++]);
        }
        while (i < v1.size()){
            arr.push_back(v1[i++]);
        }
        while (j < v2.size()){
            arr.push_back(v2[j++]);
        }        
    }

    int next() {
        return arr[p++];
    }

    bool hasNext() {
        return p < arr.size();
    }
};
