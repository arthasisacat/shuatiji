## Description
Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
Example:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int l = 0; 
        int r = numbers.size()-1;
        while (l < r){
            if ((numbers[l] + numbers[r]) == target) {
                return {l+1,r+1};
            }
            else if ((numbers[l] + numbers[r]) > target) {
                r--;
            }
            else {
                l++;
            }
        }
        return {-1,-1};
    }
};
```
