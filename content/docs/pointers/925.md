# 925. Long Pressed Name
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/long-pressed-name/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3.5

**notes**   


## Description
Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard.  Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard.  Return True if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

 

Example 1:

Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
Example 2:

Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it wasn't in the typed output.
Example 3:

Input: name = "leelee", typed = "lleeelee"
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: name = "laiden", typed = "laiden"
Output: true
Explanation: It's not necessary to long press any character.
 

Note:

name.length <= 1000
typed.length <= 1000
The characters of name and typed are lowercase letters.

## Solution

注意： 可以多打重复的字，但是不能少打应该有的。

**Correct answer:**

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isLongPressedName(string name, string typed) {
        int n1 = name.size(), n2 = typed.size();
        if (n1 == 0 || n2 == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
        
        while (p1 < n1 || p2 < n2){
            if (name[p1] == typed[p2]) {
                p1 ++;
                p2 ++;
            }
            else if (p1 > 0 && typed[p2] == name[p1-1]){
                p2++;
            }
            else{
                return false;
            }
        }
        return p1 == n1;
    }
};
```

**WRONG ANSWER**

think: why it's wrong? 

hint: try this case:

```
"alex"
"alexxr"
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isLongPressedName(string name, string typed) {
        if (name.length() == 0 || typed.size() == 0){
            return false;
        }
        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
        int n1 = name.size(), n2 = typed.size();
        char prev = '0';
        while (p1 < n1 && p2 < n2) {
            if (name[p1] == typed[p2]) {
                prev = name[p1];
                p1++;
                p2++;
            }
            else {
                if (typed[p2] == prev) {
                    p2++;
                }
                else { // != prev, != name[p1]
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return p1 == n1;
    }
};
```

explaination:

even if typed can make name, check the rest of typed to make sure it does not have garbage data at end!
