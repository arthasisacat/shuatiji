## Description

We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.

A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than 8.

A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

 

Example 1:

Input: hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].
 

Constraints:

1 <= hours.length <= 10000
0 <= hours[i] <= 16

## Solution 1 : O(n)

Use `score` to count score, rule is +1 if hour > 8, -1 if hour <= 8.

Scanning through hour in hours[], and calculating score (score is the sum from index 0 to index i). If score > 0, that means index [0~i] qualifies. res = i+1. easy.

If score < 0, we still have chance. Let's use a map called `unordered_map<int,int> seen` to record the first index that has particular score - seen[some_score] = k. Assume at position i, we have `score< 0`, we need previous score `score-1` so that `score - (score-1) > 0` is true. Thus if `seen[score-1] = k`, then `i-k` is a candidate for res. note that here it's `i-k` not `i-k+1` because index k is not included. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestWPI(vector<int>& hours) {
        int n = hours.size();
        unordered_map<int,int> seen; // score - first day that see this score
        int res = 0, score = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            score += (hours[i] > 8)? 1 : -1;
            if(score > 0){
                res = i+1;
            }
            else{
                if(seen.count(score-1)){
                    res = max(res, i - seen[score-1]);
                }
                if(!seen.count(score)){
                    seen[score] = i;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2: O(n^2)

similar to prefix sum, and use O(n^2) time to try out all [i,j] possibilities.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestWPI(vector<int>& hours) {
        int n = hours.size();
        vector<int> ps(n+1,0);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            ps[i+1] = ps[i] + (hours[i] > 8 ? 1 : -1);
        }
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = i+res; j < n; j++){
                //[i,j]
                if (ps[j+1]-ps[i] > 0){
                    res = max(res, j - i+1);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
