## Description
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution
注意`s == ""` 的特殊情况!!! `s == ""`是任何 t 的sub sequence!!!

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        if (s.length() == 0){
            return true;
        }
        if (t.length() == 0){
            return false;
        }
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (j < t.length()){
            if(t[j] == s[i]){
                i++;
            }
            j++;
            if(i == s.length()){
                break;
            }
        }
        return i == s.length();
    }
};
```
