## Description
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return false.

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution
注意`""` 的特殊情况!!! `""`是任何 t 的sub sequence!!!

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        if (s == "") {
            return true;
        }
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (j < t.length()){
            while (j < t.length() && t[j] != s[i]) {
                j++;
            }
            if (j < t.length()){
                i++;
                j++;
            }
            if (i == s.length()){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;        
    }
};
```
