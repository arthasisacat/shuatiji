## Description

Given a string s, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return the power of the string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
Example 3:

Input: s = "triplepillooooow"
Output: 5
Example 4:

Input: s = "hooraaaaaaaaaaay"
Output: 11
Example 5:

Input: s = "tourist"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxPower(string s) {
        if(s.size() <= 1){
            return s.size();
        }
        int res = 1;
        char prev = s[0];
        int cnt = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++){
            if(s[i] == prev){
                cnt++;
                res = max(res, cnt);
            }
            else{
                prev = s[i];
                cnt = 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
