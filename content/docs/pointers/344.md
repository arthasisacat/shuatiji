# 344. Reverse String
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
0

**notes**

## Description
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
```
Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
## Solution

**note**
```c++
    iter_swap(s.begin()+i, s.begin()+j);
```
OR
```c++
    swap(s[i], s[j]);
```
Both works.


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        if (s.size() <= 1) {
            return;
        }
        int i = 0;
        int j = s.size() - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            iter_swap(s.begin()+i, s.begin()+j);
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }
};
```
