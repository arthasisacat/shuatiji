# 455. Assign Cookies
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   


## Description
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]

Output: 1

Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]

Output: 2

Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        sort(begin(g), end(g));
        sort(begin(s),end(s));
        int res = 0; 
        int cookie = 0;
        int child = 0;
        while (cookie < s.size() && child < g.size()) {
            if (s[cookie] >= g[child]) {
                res++;
                cookie++;
                child++;
            }
            else {
                cookie++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
