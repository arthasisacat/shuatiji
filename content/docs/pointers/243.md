naive

## Description
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.
Example:
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
Input: word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”
Output: 3
Input: word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding"
Output: 1
Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2are both in the list.

## Solution O(n)
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int shortestDistance(vector<string>& words, string word1, string word2) {
        int i1 = -1; // idx to word1
        int i2 = -1; // idx to word2
        int res = words.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            if (words[i] == word1) {
                i1 = i;
            }
            if (words[i] == word2) {
                i2 = i;
            }
            if (i1 != -1 && i2 != -1) {
                res = min(res, abs(i1-i2));
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};```
