# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**   

## Description
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:


begin to intersect at node c1.

 

Example 1:


Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
 

Example 2:


Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
 

Example 3:


Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: null
Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
 

Notes:

If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory

## Solution 1
slow

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        ListNode* p1 = headA;
        ListNode* p2 = headB;
        while (p1 != p2) {
            p1 = p1 ? p1->next : headA;
            p2 = p2 ? p2->next : headB;
        }
        return p1;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2 fast

Make p1, p2 points to positions that have same length to the end of each list.
then move p1,p2 one step forward together, until the end. If they are the same
before reaching end, then yes we found the intersection.

This method will find the fisrt intersection part... not sure if this is correct 
if we have something like:
` [ 1, 2, 3]`  v.s. `[4, 2, 5]`

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        ListNode* p1 = headA;
        ListNode* p2 = headB;
        int l1 = 0, l2 = 0;
        while (p1) {
            l1++;
            p1 = p1->next;
        }
        while (p2) {
            l2++;
            p2 = p2->next;
        }

        // longer one is 'p1', shorter one is 'p2'
        if (l1 >= l2) {
            p1 = headA;
            p2 = headB;
        }
        else {
            p1 = headB;
            p2 = headA;
        }
        int diff = abs(l1 - l2);
        while (diff > 0) {
            p1 = p1->next;
            diff--;
        }
        
        // now p1, p2 are at same distance to the end of each list
        /*
             p1
         a -> b -> c -> x
             
             p2
              b -> c -> x
              
          (b, c are actually **identical**, just cannot draw this correct here)
        */
        while (p1 && p2) {
            if (p1 == p2) {
                return p1;
            }
            p1 = p1->next;
            p2 = p2->next;
        }
        return p1;
    }
};
```
