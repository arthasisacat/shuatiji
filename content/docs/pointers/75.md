## Description
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
You should do it in-place (sort numbers in the original array).Have you met this question in a real interview?  YesProblem Correction

```
Example
Given [1, 0, 1, 2], sort it in-place to [0, 1, 1, 2].
Challenge
A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
```
## Solution
3 pointers.

left pointer: next pos for 0
right pointer: next pos for 2.
moving pointer: i move from [0, right)

Note that when `nums[i] > 1` i do not increment, because the number nums[r] has NOT been examined yet. 

That is why while loop checks `i <= r` instead of `i < r` because when `i == r` it still needs to be checked. Example is `[1,0]`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        /* l: next position to put 0
        r : next position to put 2
        i: moving pointer.
        */
        int n = nums.size();
        int l = 0, i = 0, r = n-1; 
        while (i <= r){
            if (nums[i] < 1){
                swap(nums[i++], nums[l++]);
            }
            else if (nums[i] > 1){
                swap(nums[i], nums[r--]);
            }
            else{
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
};
};
```
