## Description

Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false

## Solution

Using set. Set is known to have NO duplicate, so trying to insert a dupe number that already exists in set will fail. Why this is ok and still works for this problem? 

Because even if there is a same number it shall pass `if (it != s.end() && (*it - nums[i]) <= t)` check and return true directly.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k, int t) {
        set<long> s;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if (i > k){
                s.erase(nums[i-k-1]);
            }
            // find x so that: nums[i] - x <= t 
            // => x >= (nums[i]-t)
            auto it = s.lower_bound((long)nums[i]-t); 
            
            // now also make sure same x satifies: x-nums[i] <= t
            if (it != s.end() && (*it - nums[i]) <= t){
                return true;
            }
            s.insert(nums[i]);
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
