do it in place!!!

## Description
Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.


In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:

Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]

Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

## Solution

To save space, we need only one array with size `rowIndex+1`. 

Key is to start with tail position for current row `i` so for row `i`, we're supposed to have `i+1` items, first i items has been filled in the array with row `i-1` situation, thus we can go from current row's last one, which is index i, and set `arr[i] = 1`, and going backwards from here. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        vector<int> res(rowIndex+1);
        res[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= rowIndex; i++){
            res[i] = 1; // tail
            /* start from tail to avoid overwriting res[j-1] problem!!!!! */
            for (int j = i-1; j > 0; j--){
                res[j] += res[j-1];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
