## Description

Given a m * n matrix mat of ones (representing soldiers) and zeros (representing civilians), return the indexes of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

A row i is weaker than row j, if the number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j, or they have the same number of soldiers but i is less than j. Soldiers are always stand in the frontier of a row, that is, always ones may appear first and then zeros.

 

Example 1:

Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers for each row is: 
row 0 -> 2 
row 1 -> 4 
row 2 -> 1 
row 3 -> 2 
row 4 -> 5 
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [2,0,3,1,4]
Example 2:

Input: mat = 
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]], 
k = 2
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers for each row is: 
row 0 -> 1 
row 1 -> 4 
row 2 -> 1 
row 3 -> 1 
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [0,2,3,1]
 

Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
2 <= n, m <= 100
1 <= k <= m
matrix[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> kWeakestRows(vector<vector<int>>& mat, int k) {
        set<pair<int,int>> s; 
        for(int i = 0; i < mat.size(); i++){
            int cnt = accumulate(begin(mat[i]), end(mat[i]), 0);
            s.insert({cnt,i});
        }
        vector<int> res;
        for(auto it = s.begin(); it != s.end() && k > 0; it++, k--){
            res.push_back(it->second);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
