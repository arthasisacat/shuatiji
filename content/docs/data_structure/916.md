# 916. Word Subsets

不是特别难 但是如何写？

## Description
We are given two arrays A and B of words.  Each word is a string of lowercase letters.

Now, say that word b is a subset of word a if every letter in b occurs in a, including multiplicity.  For example, "wrr" is a subset of "warrior", but is not a subset of "world".

Now say a word a from A is universal if for every b in B, b is a subset of a. 

Return a list of all universal words in A.  You can return the words in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
Example 2:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
Example 3:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["e","oo"]
Output: ["facebook","google"]
Example 4:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["lo","eo"]
Output: ["google","leetcode"]
Example 5:

Input: A = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], B = ["ec","oc","ceo"]
Output: ["facebook","leetcode"]
 

Note:

1 <= A.length, B.length <= 10000
1 <= A[i].length, B[i].length <= 10
A[i] and B[i] consist only of lowercase letters.
All words in A[i] are unique: there isn't i != j with A[i] == A[j].

## Solution

```c++
/*
1. get max cnt of each b in B, save it to vector<int> cnt(26)
2. get cnt of a in A, if cnt of a can cover, then it's added into res.
*/
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> wordSubsets(vector<string>& A, vector<string>& B) {
        vector<string> res;
        vector<int> cnt(26), tmp(26);
        int i = 0;
        for (auto b : B){
            tmp = counter(b);
            for (i = 0; i < 26; i++){
                cnt[i] = max(cnt[i], tmp[i]);
            }
        }
        for (auto a : A){
            tmp = counter(a);
            for (i = 0; i < 26; i++){
                if (cnt[i] > tmp[i]){
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (i == 26){
                res.push_back(a);
            }            
        }
        return res;
    }
    vector<int> counter(string s){
        vector<int> res(26);
        for (auto c : s){
            res[c-'a']++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
