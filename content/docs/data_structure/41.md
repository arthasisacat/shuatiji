## Description
Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1

**Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.**

## Solution

Put each number in its right place. For example, 5 should be put at nums[4] position. Let `n = nums.size()`, what about the numbers that are larger than n+1? Ignore them! that means there must be "gap" before!

At last, first place that is not having the right number (`nums[i] != i+1`) is the one that is wrong. If everthing is correct, return `n+1`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int firstMissingPositive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            while (nums[i] <= n && nums[i] > 0 && nums[nums[i]-1] != nums[i]){
                swap(nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]);
            }
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(nums[i] != (i+1)){
                return i+1;
            }
        }
        return n+1;
    }
};
```
