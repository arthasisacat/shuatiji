# 1167. Minimum Cost to Connect Sticks
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-connect-sticks/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   


## Description
You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y.  You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

 

Example 1:

Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
Output: 14
Example 2:

Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
Output: 30
 

Constraints:

1 <= sticks.length <= 10^4
1 <= sticks[i] <= 10^4

## Solution: greedy
Use heap to take shortest two sticks out, combine them (add cost to `res`) and put new stick back to heap.
simply sorting the original sticks *is not enough!!!!*

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int connectSticks(vector<int>& sticks) {
        priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> q(sticks.begin(), sticks.end());
        int res = 0;
        while (q.size() > 1){
            int a = q.top(); q.pop();
            int b = q.top(); q.pop();
            res += (a+b);
            q.push(a+b);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
