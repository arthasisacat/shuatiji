# 835. Image Overlap

TODO: faster method.

## Description
Two images A and B are given, represented as binary, square matrices of the same size.  (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.)

We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of units), and place it on top of the other image.  After, the overlap of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.

(Note also that a translation does not include any kind of rotation.)

What is the largest possible overlap?

Example 1:

Input: A = [[1,1,0],
            [0,1,0],
            [0,1,0]]
       B = [[0,0,0],
            [0,1,1],
            [0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We slide A to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.
Notes: 

1 <= A.length = A[0].length = B.length = B[0].length <= 30
0 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 1

## Solution 1
See [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/image-overlap/discuss/130623/C%2B%2BJavaPython-Straight-Forward)

If we do brute force, we have 2N horizontal possible sliding, 2N vertical sliding and N^2 to count overlap area.
We get O(N^4) solution and it may get accepted.
But we waste out time on case of sparse matrix.

Instead, we can use 1d array to save index where it is 1. In problem matrix len <= 30 so we can use `i+100*j` (or even `i+30*j`..) to transform 2d coordinate `[i,j]` to 1d position `i+100*j`. 

For example,
```
Input: A = [[1,1,0],
            [0,1,0],
            [0,1,0]]
       B = [[0,0,0],
            [0,1,1],
            [0,0,1]]

posA = [0,1,4,7]
posB = [4,5,8]
```
For each item in posA[i], posB[j], if offset is the same, then they are grouped to same cnt. 

Eventually, find the largest cnt.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void to_one_line(vector<vector<int>>& arr, vector<int>& pos){
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < arr[i].size(); j++){
                if(arr[i][j] == 1){
                    pos.push_back(i + 100*j); // i,j < 30
                }
            }
        }
    }
    int largestOverlap(vector<vector<int>>& A, vector<vector<int>>& B) {
        vector<int> posA, posB;
        to_one_line(A, posA);
        to_one_line(B, posB);
        unordered_map<int,int> m; // offset - cnts
        for(int i = 0; i < posA.size(); i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < posB.size(); j++){
                m[posB[j]-posA[i]] ++;
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for(auto [offset,cnt] : m){
            res= max(res,cnt);
        }
        return res;        
    }
};
```

## Solution 2: slow

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int get_overlap(vector<vector<int>>& g, int i, int j, vector<vector<int>>& B){
        int res = 0;
        for (int x = 0; x < B.size(); x++){
            for(int y = 0; y < B.size(); y++){
                if (B[x][y] == 0 || g[i+x][j+y] == 0){
                    continue;
                }
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    int largestOverlap(vector<vector<int>>& A, vector<vector<int>>& B) {
        int n = A.size();
        vector<vector<int>> g(n+(n-1)*2, vector<int>(n+(n-1)*2,0));
        for (int i = n-1; i < n+n-1; i++){
            for (int j = n-1; j < n+n-1; j++){
                // cout<<"i j "<<i<<" "<<j<<endl;
                g[i][j] = A[i-n+1][j-n+1];
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n+n-1; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < n+n-1; j++){
                // cout<<i<<" "<<j<<endl;
                res = max(res, get_overlap(g, i, j, B));
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
