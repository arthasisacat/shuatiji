# 735. Asteroid Collision
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3.5

**notes**   


## Description
We are given an array asteroids of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

Example 1:
Input: 
asteroids = [5, 10, -5]
Output: [5, 10]
Explanation: 
The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.  The 5 and 10 never collide.
Example 2:
Input: 
asteroids = [8, -8]
Output: []
Explanation: 
The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
Example 3:
Input: 
asteroids = [10, 2, -5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: 
The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5.  The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
Example 4:
Input: 
asteroids = [-2, -1, 1, 2]
Output: [-2, -1, 1, 2]
Explanation: 
The -2 and -1 are moving left, while the 1 and 2 are moving right.
Asteroids moving the same direction never meet, so no asteroids will meet each other.
Note:

The length of asteroids will be at most 10000.
Each asteroid will be a non-zero integer in the range [-1000, 1000]..

## Solution
use queue concept to put suvived asteroids into queue `res`, new asteroid if positive go to queue, if negative need to collapse with the latest asteroid in the que if the latest is positive. The collapse process will continue untill queue empty or new negative asteroid (`a` in code) is destroyed.
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> asteroidCollision(vector<int>& asteroids) {
        vector<int> res;
        for (auto a : asteroids){
            if (a > 0){
                res.push_back(a);
            }
            else{
                while (res.size() > 0 && res.back() > 0){
                    if (res.back() + a > 0){
                        a = 0; //this astoroid is destroyed
                        break;
                    }
                    else if (res.back()+a == 0){
                        a = 0; // this asteroid is destroyed
                        res.pop_back(); // the positive one in queue is destroyed
                        break;
                    }
                    else{
                        res.pop_back(); // positive one in queue is destroyed, collapse continue!
                    }                    
                }
                if (a != 0){
                    res.push_back(a);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
