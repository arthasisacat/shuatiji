# 1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List

**difficulty(1-5)**

hard in a good way.

**notes**   


## Description
Given the head of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.

 

(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,-3,3,1]
Output: [3,1]
Note: The answer [1,2,1] would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The given linked list will contain between 1 and 1000 nodes.
Each node in the linked list has -1000 <= node.val <= 1000.

## Solution
key: prefix sum.
save all prefix sum that have be seen, if the new sum is equal to older prefix sum we saved, then that means the number in between all need to be deleted. also these numbers' prefix sum needs to be removed.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        unordered_map<int,ListNode*> m;
        int sum = 0;
        ListNode* cur = dummy, *prev = nullptr;
        while (cur){
            sum += cur->val;
            if (m.count(sum)){
                ListNode* tmp = m[sum]->next;
                int s = sum;
                while (tmp != cur){
                    s += tmp->val;
                    m.erase(s);     
                    tmp = tmp->next;
                }
                cur = cur->next;
                m[sum]->next = cur;
            }
            else{
                m[sum] = cur;
                cur = cur->next;
            }
        }
        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```
