# 1122. Relative Sort Array 
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-sort-array/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**
其实挺简单，但是自己没好好想。

## Description
Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all elements in arr2 are also in arr1.

Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 are the same as in arr2.  Elements that don't appear in arr2 should be placed at the end of arr1 in ascending order.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
 

Constraints:

arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000
0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000
Each arr2[i] is distinct.
Each arr2[i] is in arr1.

## Solution
steps:
1. form a new array, let's call it `res`
2. count freq for all numbers in arr1
3. use the order of arr2 + use the freq counted in step 2, push numbers to `res`,
   reduce count along the way.
4. push remaining numbers (and freq) in arr1 to `res`


```c++
/**
this solution is NOT using the fact that 
arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000
0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000

there are other optimized solution (completely different) that 
suits 1000 size.
*/
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> relativeSortArray(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2) {
        vector<int> res;
        map<int,int> m; // num - freq
        for (auto num1 : arr1) {
            m[num1]++;
        }
        for (auto num2 : arr2){
            while (m[num2] > 0) {
                m[num2]--;
                res.push_back(num2);
            }
        }
        for (auto it : m){
            while (it.second > 0) {
                it.second--;
                res.push_back(it.first);
            }
        }
        return res;
        
    }
};
```
