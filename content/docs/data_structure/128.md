# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence 
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3

**notes**

hahaha I figured this one out on my own. So it's marked hard but not that
hard at all!

## Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
```
Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```
## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    /*
    find longest consecutive sequence that include k in m, 
    all numbers must be unvisited to form this sequence. 
    return length.
    way to implement it:
    start from k, go k-1, k-2... as long as m[] can find it.
    go k+1, k+2... as long as m[] can find it.
    add left part + 1 + right part = res
    */
    int helper(unordered_map<int,bool>& m, int k) {
        int res = 1; // length for k
        m[k] = true;
        int p = k-1;
        while (m.count(p)) {
            res++;
            m[p] = true;
            p--;
        }
        p = k+1;
        while (m.count(p)) {
            res++;
            m[p] = true;
            p++;
        }
        return res;        
    }

    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int,bool> m;
        for (auto num : nums) {
            m[num] =  false;
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (m.count(nums[i]) && m[nums[i]] == false){
                res = max(res, helper(m, nums[i]));
            }
        }
        return res;        
    }
};
```
