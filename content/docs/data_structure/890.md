# 890. Find and Replace Pattern
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-pattern/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   

## Description
You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.
A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.
(Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)
Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern. 
You may return the answer in any order.
```
Example 1:
Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
```
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
since a and b map to the same letter.

Note:
1 <= words.length <= 50
1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20


## Solution
2 hash table. Because 'permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to same letter'

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findAndReplacePattern(vector<string>& words, string pattern) {
        vector<string> res;
        for (auto word : words){
            if (is_match(word, pattern)){
                res.push_back(word);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    bool is_match(string w, string p){
        if (w.length() != p.length()){
            return false;
        }
        unordered_map<char,char> w2p;
        unordered_map<char,char> p2w;
        for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++){
            if (!w2p.count(w[i]) && !p2w.count(p[i])) {
                w2p[w[i]] = p[i];
                p2w[p[i]] = w[i];
            }
            else if (w2p[w[i]] != p[i] || p2w[p[i]] != w[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
