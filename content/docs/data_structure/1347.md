# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-steps-to-make-two-strings-anagram/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   


## Description
Given two equal-size strings s and t. In one step you can choose any character of t and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make t an anagram of s.

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "bab", t = "aba"
Output: 1
Explanation: Replace the first 'a' in t with b, t = "bba" which is anagram of s.
Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcode", t = "practice"
Output: 5
Explanation: Replace 'p', 'r', 'a', 'i' and 'c' from t with proper characters to make t anagram of s.
Example 3:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "mangaar"
Output: 0
Explanation: "anagram" and "mangaar" are anagrams. 
Example 4:

Input: s = "xxyyzz", t = "xxyyzz"
Output: 0
Example 5:

Input: s = "friend", t = "family"
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 50000
s.length == t.length
s and t contain lower-case English letters only.

## Solution
count number of differences, remember the result is devided by 2!!!

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minSteps(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> cnts(26,0);
        for (auto c : s){
            cnts[c-'a']++;
        }
        for (auto c : t){
            cnts[c-'a']--;
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (auto cnt : cnts){
            res += abs(cnt);
        }
        return res/2; //!!!! remember to /2!
    }
};
```
