# 997. Find the Town Judge
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   


## Description
In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.

If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Example 4:

Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: -1
Example 5:

Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
Output: 3
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 1000
trust.length <= 10000
trust[i] are all different
trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int N, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
        vector<int> cnts(N+1, 0); // 1-N is used!! discard 0
        for (auto p : trust) {
            cnts[p[0]] = -1;
            if (cnts[p[1]] != -1) {
                cnts[p[1]]++;
            }
        }
        int candidates = 0;
        int last_candidate_idx = -1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
            if (cnts[i] == (N-1)) {
                candidates++;
                last_candidate_idx = i;
            }
        }
        return candidates == 1 ? last_candidate_idx : -1;        
    }
};

```
