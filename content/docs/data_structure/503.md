# 503. Next Greater Element II
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   


## Description
Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

## Solution
circular: means we can go through the arr twice.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElements(vector<int>& nums) {
        stack<int> s;
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> res(n, -1);
        for (int i = 0; i < 2*n; i++){
            while (!s.empty() && nums[s.top()] < nums[i%n]){
                res[s.top()] = nums[i%n];
                s.pop();
            }
            s.push(i%n);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
