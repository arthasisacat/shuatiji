**notes**


## Description
We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Return a list of all uncommon words. 

You may return the list in any order. 

Example 1:

Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
Example 2:

Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
 

Note:

0 <= A.length <= 200
0 <= B.length <= 200
A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.

## Solution

The problem is simply asking words that only appear once if we contatenate A and B together.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> uncommonFromSentences(string A, string B) {
        unordered_map<string,int> map;
        istringstream ssa(A);
        string tmp;

        while (ssa >> tmp) {
            map[tmp]++;
        }
        istringstream ssb(B);
        while (ssb >> tmp) {
            map[tmp]++;
        }
        vector<string> res;
        for (auto p : map) {
            if (p.second == 1) {
                res.push_back(p.first);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
