**notes**   


## Description

Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:

Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:

Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

## Solution

Use stack. 
1. While new digit is smaller than top of stack, pop top of stack, decrement k.
2. push new digit to stack. To avoid excessive 0, only push to stack if it's *not* 0, or stack is not empty(when stack is not empty, 0 must be pushed to stack)
3. after finishing 1&2, if k is still not 0, we need to use those k. by now we have ascending numbers in stack like this: 1349, if k is 2, which 2 number we should remove? of course the later 2!

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeKdigits(string num, int k) {
        string s; // use as stack, also it's the final result
        for(auto c : num){
            while(s.size() > 0 && s.back() > c && k){
                s.pop_back();
                k--;
            }
            if(c != '0' || s.size() > 0){
                s.push_back(c);
            }
        }
        
        // now s is already ascending and we still have unused k quota,
        // delete more chars from right to left
        while(k > 0 && s.size() > 0){
            s.pop_back();
            k--;
        }
        return s == "" ? "0" : s;
    }
};
```
