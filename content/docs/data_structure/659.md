**notes**   


## Description
Given an array nums sorted in ascending order, return true if and only if you can split it into 1 or more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has length at least 3.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5

Example 3:

Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10000

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPossible(vector<int>& nums) {
        // tail[i]: number of subsequences whose length is >= 3 also must end with number i as its tail.
        unordered_map<int,int> tail, cnt;
        for (auto num : nums){
            cnt[num]++;
        }
        for (auto num : nums){
            if (cnt[num] <= 0){
                continue;
            }
            cnt[num]--;
            if (tail[num-1] > 0){
                tail[num] += 1;
                tail[num-1]--;
            }
            else{
                // use num to form new subsequence, must have num+1, num+2 ready
                // so we "overdraw" num+1 and num+2 from cnt[] if they exist. 
                if (cnt[num+1] <= 0 || cnt[num+2] <= 0){
                    return false;
                }
                else {
                    cnt[num+1]--;
                    cnt[num+2]--;
                    tail[num+2]++;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
