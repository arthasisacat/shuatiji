# 1399. Count Largest Group

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-largest-group/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 


**notes**   


## Description

Given an integer n. Each number from 1 to n is grouped according to the sum of its digits. 

Return how many groups have the largest size.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 13
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
[1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. There are 4 groups with largest size.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.
Example 3:

Input: n = 15
Output: 6
Example 4:

Input: n = 24
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4

## Solution
seems like there is no good way to calculate sum of digits in a number, so just brute force. 
Good new is 1 <= n <= 10^4 so we know the max sum of digits is 9+9+9+9 = 36


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int digit_sum(int n){
        if (n == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        int res = n%10;
        return res + digit_sum(n/10);
    }
    int countLargestGroup(int n) {
        // n <= 10000 so max digit sum is 9999's digit sum = 36
        vector<int> cnt(37,0);
        int max_cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            int dsum = digit_sum(i);
            cnt[dsum]++;
            max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cnt[dsum]);
        }
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i <= 36; i++){
            if (cnt[i] == max_cnt){
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;        
    }
};
```
