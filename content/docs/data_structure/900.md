## Description
Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by RLEIterator(int[] A), where A is a run-length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even i, A[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value A[i+1] is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: next(int n), which exhausts the next n elements (n >= 1) and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust, next returns -1 instead.

For example, we start with A = [3,8,0,9,2,5], which is a run-length encoding of the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].  This is because the sequence can be read as "three eights, zero nines, two fives".

 

Example 1:

Input: ["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]
Output: [null,8,8,5,-1]
Explanation: 
RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).
This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].
RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1.

Note:

0 <= A.length <= 1000
A.length is an even integer.
0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
There are at most 1000 calls to RLEIterator.next(int n) per test case.
Each call to RLEIterator.next(int n) will have 1 <= n <= 10^9.

## Solution
毫无技术含量的硬做。

```c++
class RLEIterator {
private:
    deque<pair<int,int>> q; // saves occurance-val
    long size; // sum of occurances
public:
    RLEIterator(vector<int>& A) {
        size = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i+=2){
            if (A[i] == 0){
                continue;
            }
            q.push_back({A[i], A[i+1]});
            size += A[i];
        }
    }
    
    int next(int n) {
        size -= n;
        if (size < 0){
            return -1;
        }
        while (n){
            auto cur = q.front(); q.pop_front();
            if (cur.first >= n){
                cur.first -= n;
                if (cur.first > 0){
                    q.push_front(cur);
                }
                return cur.second;
            }
            else{
                n -= cur.first;
            }
        }
        return -1; // never hit here?        
    }
};

/**
 * Your RLEIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * RLEIterator* obj = new RLEIterator(A);
 * int param_1 = obj->next(n);
 */
