# 883. Projection Area of 3D Shapes 
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/projection-area-of-3d-shapes/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
1

**notes**
boring and the description is really bad. 
no need to look at it again.

## Description
On a N * N grid, we place some 1 * 1 * 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of grid cell (i, j).

Now we view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane. 

Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[2]]
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis-aligned plane.

Example 3:

Input: [[1,0],[0,2]]
Output: 8
Example 4:

Input: [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 14
Example 5:

Input: [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 21
 

Note:

1 <= grid.length = grid[0].length <= 50
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int projectionArea(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                // for xy plane
                if (grid[i][j]) {
                    res++;
                }    
            }
        }
        
        // xz plane - add max in row together
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            res += *max_element(grid[i].begin(), grid[i].end());
        }
        
        // yz plane - add max in col together
        for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
            int tmp = INT_MIN;
            for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
                tmp = max(tmp, grid[i][j]);
            }
            res += tmp;
        }
        return res;
            
    }
};
```
