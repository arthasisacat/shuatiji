# 825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
age[B] > age[A]
age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100
Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

Example 1:

Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
Example 2:

Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
Example 3:

Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.

## Solution
there are a lot of people, like 20000. 
but age only range from 1 to 120. 
so it's better to calculate the frequency of each age. 

- remember that if for same age, people in same age can make friend but the friend requests count = cnt*(cnt-1)
- for different ages, if a age can request friend to b age, then count = a_cnt * b_cnt

```c++
/*utilize the fact that we might have 10000 people but their
age are 0~120!!!! */
class Solution {
public:
    // return true if a will request to b
    // third condition is redundant!
    bool will_request(int a, int b){
        return !((b <= (a/2 + 7))|| (b > a));
    }
    int numFriendRequests(vector<int>& ages) {
        int res = 0;
        unordered_map<int,int> m; // age - cnt
        for (auto a : ages){
            m[a]++;
        }
        for (auto& a : m){
            for (auto& b : m){
                if (will_request(a.first, b.first)){
                    res += a.second * (b.second - ((a.first == b.first) ? 1 : 0)); 
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
