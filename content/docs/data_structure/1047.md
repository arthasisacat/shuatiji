# 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String

Look at solution 1!!!
Follow up : [1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II](/docs/1209)

## Description
Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
 

Note:

1 <= S.length <= 20000
S consists only of English lowercase letters.

## Solution 1: 2 pointer, O(n)
i points to the next character in the output string.
j points to current iteration character. j will increment by 1 every iteration.
In every iteration, do following:
- if S[j] is the same as S[i-1](the last char in output string), i-2
- else, just set S[j] as the new char in output string, whose position is i.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string S) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < S.length(); i++, j++){
            S[i] = S[j];
            if (i > 0 && S[i-1] == S[i]){
                i -= 2;
            }            
        }
        return S.substr(0,i);
    }
};
```
## Solution 2
use concept of stack

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string removeDuplicates(string S) {
        // use stack
        string stk;
        for (auto c : S) {
            if (!stk.empty() && stk.back() == c) {
                stk.pop_back();
            }
            else {
                stk += c;
            }
        }
        return stk;
    }
};
```
