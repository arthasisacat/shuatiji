# 1046. Last Stone Weight
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   


## Description
We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose the two heaviest rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:

If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

 

Example 1:

Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the value of last stone.
 

Note:

1 <= stones.length <= 30
1 <= stones[i] <= 1000

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeight(vector<int>& stones) {
        priority_queue<int> q(stones.begin(), stones.end());
        while (q.size() > 1) {
            int big1 = q.top(); q.pop();
            int big2 = q.top(); q.pop();
            q.push(abs(big1 - big2));
        }
        return q.top();
    }
};
```
