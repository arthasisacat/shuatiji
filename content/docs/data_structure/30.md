# 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4.5

**notes**   


## Description

You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

 

Example 1:

Input:
  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
  words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
Example 2:

Input:
  s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
  words = ["word","good","best","word"]
Output: []

## Solution

Build `unordered_map<string,int> cnt` to cnt each words frequency. This `cnt` will not be changed, only be copied and modified on copy.

Start with index `i` to form word (note here word length is always the same), add to `unordered_map<string,cnt> seen` to track word frequency seen so far. whenever `seen[w] > cnt[w]`, exit this try. Otherwise, just keep adding things to seen.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findSubstring(string s, vector<string>& words) {
        vector<int> res;
        int n = s.size(), num = words.size();
        if (num == 0 || n == 0){
            return res;
        }
        int len = words[0].size();
        unordered_map<string,int> cnt;
        for(auto word : words){
            cnt[word]++;
        }
        for(int i = 0; i <= (n - num*len); i++){
            unordered_map<string,int> seen;
            int k = 0;
            for(; k < num; k++){
                string w = s.substr(i+k*len, len);
                if (cnt.count(w)){
                    seen[w]++;
                    if(seen[w] > cnt[w]){
                        break;
                    }
                }
                else{
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (k == num){
                res.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
