# 771. Jewels and Stones
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
0

**notes**   

## Description
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numJewelsInStones(string J, string S) {
        unordered_set<char> jewels(J.begin(), J.end());
        int res = 0;
        for (auto stone : S){
            if (jewels.count(stone)) {
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};```
