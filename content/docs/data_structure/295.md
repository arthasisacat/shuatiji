# 295. Find Median from Data Stream
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   
difficulty was 5, but on second time I managed to ac with 1 try

## Description
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example,
[2,3,4], the median is 3

[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
 

Example:
```
addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2
```

If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?
If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?


## Solution
```c++
class MedianFinder {
private:
    /*
    If we imagine to cut half on n sorted numbers, we want to:
    - store smaller half (including middle one for odd n) on max_heap,
      top of max_heap is biggest number of this half
    - store bigger half on min_heap, top of min_heap is smallest number
    of this half
    - always keep (n+1)/2 numbers on max_heap. 
      Thus for n is even (say n = 4), (n+1)/2 = 2 are on max_heap, 
      n - (n+1)/2 = 2 are on min_heap; 
      for n is odd (say n = 3), (n+1)/2 = 2 are on max_heap, 1 is on min_heap
    - when getting median, if n is odd, top of max_heap is the result;
      if n is even, (max_heap.top() + min_heap.top())/2 is result.
      
    Time complexity: 
    - for each insertion: O(logn)
    - total: O(nlogn)
    */
    priority_queue<int,vector<int>> max_heap;
    priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> min_heap;
    int n = 0;
public:
    MedianFinder() {        
    }
    
    void addNum(int num) {
        n++;
        if (max_heap.empty()) {
            max_heap.push(num);
            return;
        }
        if (n % 2) { // n is odd, was even, add one more to max_heap(for small numbers)
            if (num <= min_heap.top()) {
                max_heap.push(num);
            }
            else {
                max_heap.push(min_heap.top());
                min_heap.pop();
                min_heap.push(num);
            }
        }
        else { // n is even, was odd, add one more to min_heap(for big numbers)
            if (num >= max_heap.top()){
                min_heap.push(num);
            }
            else {
                min_heap.push(max_heap.top());
                max_heap.pop();
                max_heap.push(num);
            }
        }
    }
    
    double findMedian() {
        if (n % 2) {
            // n odd
            return (double) max_heap.top();
        }
        // n even
        return ((double)max_heap.top() + (double)min_heap.top())/2;
    }
};
```
## Solution to follow up
1. **If all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?**

We can maintain an integer array of length 100 to store the count of each number along with a total count. Then, we can iterate over the array to find the middle value to get our median.

Time and space complexity would be O(100) = O(1).

1. **If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are between 0 and 100, how would you optimize it?**

In this case, we need an integer array of length 100 and a hashmap for these numbers that are not in [0,100].
