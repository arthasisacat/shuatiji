# 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**   


## Description
Given an array A, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:

Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
left and right are non-empty.
left has the smallest possible size.
Return the length of left after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: [5,0,3,8,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,0,6,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]
 

Note:

2 <= A.length <= 30000
0 <= A[i] <= 10^6
It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition A as described.

## Solution
1. from right to left, record min_right that we have seen to min_right[i]
2. from left to right, if max_left we have seen is smaller than min right to i (`min_right[i]`) this means we have found the i.
3. 
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int partitionDisjoint(vector<int>& A) {
        int n = A.size();
        vector<int> min_right(n,INT_MAX);
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--){
            min_right[i] = (i < (n-1)) ? min(min_right[i+1], A[i]) : A[i];
            // cout<<"min right "<<i <<" = "<<min_right[i]<<endl;
        }
        int i = 0;
        int max_left = A[0];
        while(i < n){
            i++;
            if (max_left <= min_right[i]){
                break;
            }
            max_left = max(max_left, A[i]);
        }
        return i;
    }
};
```
