## Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
Example :
Input: n = 10, pick = 6 //<= this is wrong. pick = 6 is not given
Output: 6

## Solution
题目其实只是叫你写二分直到猜中数字而已. 
```c++
// Forward declaration of guess API.
// @param num, your guess
// @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
int guess(int num);

class Solution {
public:
    int guessNumber(int n) {
        int s = 1, e = n;
        while (s + 1 < e){
            int mid = s + (e - s)/2;
            int res = guess(mid);
            if (res == 0){
                return mid;
            }
            else if (res == -1) {
                e = mid;
            }
            else {
                s = mid;
            }
        }
        return guess(s) == 0 ? s : e;
    }
};
```
