## Description

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

## Solution

binary search by result. Need to sort citations[] first. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end());
        int n = citations.size();
        if(n == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        // binary search by result
        int s = 0, e = n; 
        while(s + 1 < e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s)/2;
            if(citations[n-mid] >= mid){
                s = mid;
            }
            else{
                e = mid;
            }
        }
        if(citations[n-e] >= e){
            return e;
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```
