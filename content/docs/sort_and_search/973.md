# 973. K Closest Points to Origin
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3

**notes**   


## Description
We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the Kclosest points to the origin (0, 0).
(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)
You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)
```
Example 1:
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
Example 2:
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)
```

Note:

1 <= K <= points.length <= 10000
-10000 < points[i][0] < 10000
-10000 < points[i][1] < 10000

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int K) {
        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](vector<int>&a, vector<int>&b){
            return ((a[0]*a[0]+a[1]*a[1]) < (b[0]*b[0] + b[1]*b[1]));  
        });
        return vector<vector<int>>(points.begin(), points.begin()+K);
    }
};
```

## Solution: longer, using priority queue
```c++
struct comp
{
    // queue elements are vectors so we need to compare those
    bool operator()(std::vector<int> const& a, std::vector<int> const& b) const
    {
        return (a[0]*a[0] + a[1]*a[1]) < (b[0]*b[0] + b[1]*b[1]) ? true : false;
    }
};
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int K) {
        priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, comp> pq;
        for (auto p : points){
            pq.push(p);
            if(pq.size() > K){
                pq.pop();
            }
        }
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        while(K--){
            res.push_back(pq.top());
            pq.pop();
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
