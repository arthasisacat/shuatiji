## Description
Given an array of strings products and a string searchWord. We want to design a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each character of searchWord is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with the searchWord. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.

Return list of lists of the suggested products after each character of searchWord is typed. 

 

Example 1:

Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"],
["mouse","mousepad"]
]
Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = ["mobile","moneypot","monitor","mouse","mousepad"]
After typing m and mo all products match and we show user ["mobile","moneypot","monitor"]
After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests ["mouse","mousepad"]
Example 2:

Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
Example 3:

Input: products = ["bags","baggage","banner","box","cloths"], searchWord = "bags"
Output: [["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags","banner"],["baggage","bags"],["bags"]]
Example 4:

Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "tatiana"
Output: [[],[],[],[],[],[],[]]
 

Constraints:

1 <= products.length <= 1000
There are no repeated elements in products.
1 <= Î£ products[i].length <= 2 * 10^4
All characters of products[i] are lower-case English letters.
1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000
All characters of searchWord are lower-case English letters.

## Solution 1: fast
Sort the products! then use binary search to locate the first (and smallest) word that match current prefix. and then provide second and third options, which follows that first one (if they exist, they must match the prefix).

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> suggestedProducts(vector<string>& products, string searchWord) {
        vector<vector<string>> res;
        auto it = products.begin();
        sort(it, products.end());
        string cur = "";
        for (auto c : searchWord){
            cur += c;
            it = lower_bound(it, products.end(), cur);
            vector<string> suggest;
            for (int i = 0; i < 3 && (it+i) != products.end(); i++){
                string s = *(it + i);
                if (s.find(cur) == string::npos){ // npos = -1
                    break;
                }
                suggest.push_back(s);                
            }
            res.push_back(suggest);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2: TRIE, slow

```c++
class node {
public:
    bool is_word;
    vector<node*> children;
    node(){
        this->is_word = false;
        this->children.assign(26,nullptr);
    }
};
class Solution {
private:
    node* h;
    void trie_insert(string s){
        node* cur = h;
        for (auto c : s){
            if (!cur->children[c-'a']){
                cur->children[c-'a'] = new node();
            }
            cur = cur->children[c-'a'];
        }
        cur->is_word = true;
    }
    
    vector<string> trie_find_3_with_prefix(string prefix){
        // return first 3 word with given prefix, in lexicographical order
        vector<string> res;
        node* cur = h;
        for (auto c : prefix){
            if (!cur->children[c-'a']){
                return res; // no matching
            }
            cur = cur->children[c-'a'];
        }
        dfs(res, cur, prefix);
        return res;
    }
    
    void dfs(vector<string>& res, node* cur, string s){
        if (res.size() == 3){
            return;
        }
        if (cur->is_word){
            res.push_back(s);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++){
            if (cur->children[i]){
                dfs(res, cur->children[i], s+(char)(i+'a'));
            }
        }        
    }
public:
    vector<vector<string>> suggestedProducts(vector<string>& products, string searchWord) {
        h = new node();
        for (auto p : products){
            trie_insert(p);
        }
        vector<vector<string>> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < searchWord.size(); i++){
            res.push_back(trie_find_3_with_prefix(searchWord.substr(0,i+1)));
        }
        return res;
    }
};
