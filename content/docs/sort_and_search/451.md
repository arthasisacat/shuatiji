# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   
Learn the template of customized sorting for `set<pair<int,int>>`!!!

## Description
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
```
Example 1:

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```
```
Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```
## Solution 1: sort!
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string frequencySort(string s) {
        int counts[256] = {0};
        for (auto c : s){
            counts[c]++;
        }
        sort(s.begin(), s.end(), [&](char a, char b){
            if (counts[a] == counts[b]){ 
                // e.g. "olol" needs to sorted as "lloo"
                return a < b;
            }
            return counts[a] > counts[b];
        });
        return s;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2: bucket sort.
 Downside is we have to create a bucket to be the size of `(s.length()+1)`.
