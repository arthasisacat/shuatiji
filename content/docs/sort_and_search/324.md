# 324. Wiggle Sort II

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-sort-ii/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
6

**notes**   
super super hard

## Description

Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4]
Output: One possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: One possible answer is [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2].
Note:
You may assume all input has valid answer.

Follow Up:
Can you do it in O(n) time and/or in-place with O(1) extra space?

## Solution

This problem consists of 3 parts:
1. we need to find half numbers that are larger than other half. how? by looking for medium. How to find medium? "find kth largest element in array" (leetcode 215, [link]({{< ref "215.md" >}})). Here we just use `nth_element()` stl function. this function also put smaller half on left side, bigger half on right side. 
2. vitual wiring [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-sort-ii/discuss/77677/O(n)%2BO(1)-after-median-Virtual-Indexing)
3. sort 3 colors in O(n) time and O(1) extra space (in place) is another problem [75. Sort Colors]({{< ref "75.md" >}})
   
Key is number 2 virtual index wiring, it's very hard...


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void wiggleSort(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        nth_element(nums.begin(), nums.begin()+n/2, nums.end());
        int med = nums[n/2];
        
        #define A(i) nums[(1+2*(i))%(n|1)]
        
        int i = 0, l = 0, r = n-1;
        while(i <= r){
            if(A(i) > med){
                swap(A(i++), A(l++));
            }
            else if (A(i) < med){
                swap(A(i), A(r--));
            }
            else{
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
