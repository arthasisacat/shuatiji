## Description

Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive integers which are divisible by a or b or c.



Example 1:

Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4th is 6.
Example 3:

Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13
Output: 10
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5th is 10.
Example 4:

Input: n = 1000000000, a = 2, b = 217983653, c = 336916467
Output: 1999999984
 

Constraints:

1 <= n, a, b, c <= 10^9
1 <= a * b * c <= 10^18
It's guaranteed that the result will be in range [1, 2 * 10^9]

for x, define F(x) as number of ugly numbers from 1~x:
F(x) = a + b + c - ab - ac - bc + abc

then do binary search to find the smallest number that has n ugly numbers.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int nthUglyNumber(int n, int A, int B, int C) {
        // binary search by res
        long a = (long)A, b= (long)B, c = (long) C;
        long ab = a*b/__gcd(a,b);
        long bc = b*c/__gcd(b,c);
        long ac = a*c/__gcd(a,c);
        long abc = a*bc/__gcd(a,bc);
        auto get_cnt = [&](long num){
            return num/a + num/b + num/c - num/ab - num/ac - num/bc + num/abc;
        };
        int s = 1, e = 2*1000000009;
        while(s+1 < e){
            int mid = s + (e-s)/2;
            int cnt = get_cnt(mid);
            if (cnt < n){
                s = mid;
            }
            else{
                e = mid;
            }
        }
        if(get_cnt(s) == n){
            return s;
        }
        return e;
    }
};
```
