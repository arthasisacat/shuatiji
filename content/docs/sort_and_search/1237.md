## Description
Given a function  f(x, y) and a value z, return all positive integer pairs x and y where f(x,y) == z.

The function is constantly increasing, i.e.:

f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y)
f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)
The function interface is defined like this: 

interface CustomFunction {
public:
  // Returns positive integer f(x, y) for any given positive integer x and y.
  int f(int x, int y);
};
For custom testing purposes you're given an integer function_id and a target z as input, where function_id represent one function from an secret internal list, on the examples you'll know only two functions from the list.  

You may return the solutions in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: function_id = 1, z = 5
Output: [[1,4],[2,3],[3,2],[4,1]]
Explanation: function_id = 1 means that f(x, y) = x + y
Example 2:

Input: function_id = 2, z = 5
Output: [[1,5],[5,1]]
Explanation: function_id = 2 means that f(x, y) = x * y
 

Constraints:

1 <= function_id <= 9
1 <= z <= 100
It's guaranteed that the solutions of f(x, y) == z will be on the range 1 <= x, y <= 1000
It's also guaranteed that f(x, y) will fit in 32 bit signed integer if 1 <= x, y <= 1000

## Solution
see [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-positive-integer-solution-for-a-given-equation/discuss/414249/JavaC%2B%2BPython-O(X%2BY)) for explanation.

**Intuition**
Rephrase the problem:
Given a matrix, each row and each column is increasing.
Find all coordinates (i,j) that A[i][j] == z

**Complexity**
In binary search,
time complexity is O(XlogY) or O(YlogX)

In this solution,
time complexity is stable O(X + Y).

Bianry search is really an unnecessay operation,
and it won't help improve the conplexity at all.

Space is O(X)

```c++
/*
 * // This is the custom function interface.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * class CustomFunction {
 * public:
 *     // Returns f(x, y) for any given positive integers x and y.
 *     // Note that f(x, y) is increasing with respect to both x and y.
 *     // i.e. f(x, y) < f(x + 1, y), f(x, y) < f(x, y + 1)
 *     int f(int x, int y);
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> findSolution(CustomFunction& customfunction, int z) {
        int y = 1000;
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        for (int x = 1; x <= 1000; x++) {
            while (y > 1 // here cannot do y >= 1 !!! because after y-- y will become 0 after exit from this while loop.
                   && customfunction.f(x,y) > z) {
                y--;
            }
            if (customfunction.f(x,y) == z) {
                res.push_back({x,y});
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
