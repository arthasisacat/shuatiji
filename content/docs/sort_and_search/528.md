# 528. Random Pick with Weight
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
Given an array w of positive integers, where w[i]describes the weight of index i, write a function pickIndex which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.
```
Note:
1 <= w.length <= 10000
1 <= w[i] <= 10^5
pickIndex will be called at most 10000 times.

Example 1:
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex"]
[[[1]],[]]
Output: [null,0]

Example 2:
Input: 
["Solution","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex","pickIndex"]
[[[1,3]],[],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,1,1,1,0]
Explanation of Input Syntax:
The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array w. pickIndex has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
```


## Solution

题目写的有点不清楚. 实际意思就是按照权重来做 rand(). 权重越高, 被 pick 到的几率就越大.

        
ps[] is increasing arr. find index i so that ps[i] is the first one larger to k (cannot be equal!) 

for example:
```
index    0    1 
  w    [ 2,   3 ]
 ps    [ 2,   5 ]

we can roll weighless rand()%5, we can get 
           [0,1,|| 2,3,4]
            ----||------
    index     0 ||   1 

this means if we roll 0/1 return 0, if we roll 2/3/4 return 1. 
if we roll k, return index `i` that `ps[i]` is the first number in ps[] that is (strictly) larger than k. 

```

```c++
class Solution {
private: 
    vector<int> ps;
public:
    Solution(vector<int>& w) {
        ps.assign(w.size(),0);
        ps[0] = w[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < w.size(); i++){
            ps[i] = ps[i-1] + w[i];
        }
    }
    
    int pickIndex() {
        int k = rand()%ps.back(); // weighless index
        
        // ps[] is increasing arr. find index i so that ps[i] is the first one
        // larger to k (cannot be equal!) 
        int s = 0, e = ps.size()-1;
        while (s+1 < e) {
            int mid = s + (e-s)/2;
            if (ps[mid] > k){
                e = mid;
            }
            else {
                s = mid;
            }
        }
        return (ps[s] > k) ? s : e;
    }
};
```
