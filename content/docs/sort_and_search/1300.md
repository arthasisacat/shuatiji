# 1300. Sum of Mutated Array Closest to Target

**notes**   

## Description
Given an integer array arr and a target value target, return the integer value such that when we change all the integers larger than value in the given array to be equal to value, the sum of the array gets as close as possible (in absolute difference) to target.

In case of a tie, return the minimum such integer.

Notice that the answer is not neccesarilly a number from arr.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [4,9,3], target = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: When using 3 arr converts to [3, 3, 3] which sums 9 and that's the optimal answer.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [2,3,5], target = 10
Output: 5
Example 3:

Input: arr = [60864,25176,27249,21296,20204], target = 56803
Output: 11361
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 10^4
1 <= arr[i], target <= 10^5

## Solution
1. sort ascendingly.
2. i = 0 ~ n-1, every time for i, target is updated to subtract former arr[i],
   if target > (n-i)*arr[i] this means we can keep arr[i] value, don't need to change it.
   if target <= (n-i)*arr[i], this means sum of `arr[0]+arr[1]+...+arr[i-1] + (n-i)*arr[i]` 
   JUST EXCEEDS target. 
   So:
   res is ~ (original_target - sum(arr[0]~arr[i-1]))/(n-i) = (current_target)/(n-i)

   why target-0.01?? because if it's a tie we want the smaller integer. 
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findBestValue(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int n = arr.size();
        int i = 0;
        while(i < n && target > (arr[i] * (n-i))){
            target -= arr[i];
            i++;
        }
        if (i == n){
            return arr[i];
        }
        //Since we need to return the minimum such integer if there is a tie,
        // if target / len(A) has 0.5 we should round down,
        return (int)round((target-0.01)/(n-i));
    }
};
```
