# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array)

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**   


## Description
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```
## Solution

This looks like an easy problem. But remember to take into non-rotated situation into considerations, and make sure your code works in that situation.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.size(), l = 0, r = n-1;
        if (n == 0){
            return -1;
        }
        while(l + 1 < r){
            int mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            if (nums[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            }
            else if(nums[mid] > nums[n-1]){ // mid on left half
                if(target <= nums[n-1] || target > nums[mid]){ // target is on right side compared to mid
                    l = mid;
                }
                else{
                    r = mid;
                }
            }
            else{ // mid on right half
                if(target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[n-1]){
                    l = mid;
                }
                else{
                    r = mid;
                }                
            }
        }
        if(nums[l] == target){
            return l;
        }
        if(nums[r] == target){
            return r;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
