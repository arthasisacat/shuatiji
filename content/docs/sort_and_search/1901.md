## Description
A peak element in a 2D grid is an element that is strictly greater than all of its adjacent neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a 0-indexed m x n matrix mat where no two adjacent cells are equal, find any peak element mat[i][j] and return the length 2 array [i,j].

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an outer perimeter with the value -1 in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(m log(n)) or O(n log(m)) time.

Constraints:

m == mat.length
n == mat[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 500
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 105
No two adjacent cells are equal.

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.

Example 2:

Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.

## Solution

Steps:
1. pick a column, let's pick middle column
2. inside the picked column, find the biggest number - so that it's already larger than it's upper and lower number neighbor.
3. if the biggest number  is larger than left and right neighbor, GREAT, JOB DONE! RETURN.
4. *if the biggest number's left neighbor is larger than it*, then go to left side. Otherwise, go to right side. 
   why?
   because if left neighbor is larger than biggest number in current column, then left column's biggest number MUST be bigger than it's right neighbor (right neighbor)

Time complexity:
Assum matrix row and column size is `m x n`
we need to find largest number in the column, that's `m` 
for columns, we're doing binary search, that's `log(n)`
thus, it's `mlog(n)`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    
    /* return {x,y}
    x: = -1 if column j has NO row that is good
    x: = row number if this cell (x,j) is good
    y: = 1 if some row i in column j is smaller than left side && j > 0

        int max_row = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < mat.size(); i++) // first, find biggest number in this column
        {
            if (mat[i][j] > mat[max_row][j])
            {
                max_row = i;
            }
        }
        if ((j == 0 || mat[max_row][j] > mat[max_row][j-1])
           && (j+1 == mat[0].size() || mat[max_row][j] > mat[max_row][j+1]))
        {
            res[0] = max_row;
        }
        if (j == 0 || mat[max_row][j] < mat[max_row][j-1])
        {
            res[1] = 1;
        }
        // cout<<"j "<<j<<" max_row "<<max_row<<" - " <<res[0]<<" "<<res[1]<<endl;
        return res;

        int num_rol = mat.size(), num_col = mat[0].size();
        int start = 0, end = num_col - 1;
        vector<int> tmp = {-1, -1};
        while (start + 1 < end)
        {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

            }
            else if (tmp[1] == 1) // left side has potential, go to left
            {
                end = mid;
            }
            else // go to right side
            {
                start = mid;
