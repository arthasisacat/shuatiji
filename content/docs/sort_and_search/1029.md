# 1029. Two City Scheduling

## Description
There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the i-th person to city A is costs[i][0], and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is costs[i][1].

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N people arrive in each city.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
 

Note:

1 <= costs.length <= 100
It is guaranteed that costs.length is even.
1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000

## Solution
to optimize, instead of sorting, we could use quick select
```c++
  nth_element(begin(cs), begin(cs) + cs.size() / 2, end(cs), [](vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b) {
    return (a[0] - a[1] < b[0] - b[1]);
  }); 
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int twoCitySchedCost(vector<vector<int>>& costs) {
        // sort by "the money saved if go to A instead of B"
        // = the money of going to B - A
        sort(begin(costs), end(costs), [](vector<int>& c1, vector<int>& c2){
            // if this is true (which means c1 saves more), c1 comes first in sorting
            return (c1[1] - c1[0]) > (c2[1] - c2[0]); 
        });
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < costs.size()/2; i++) {
            res += costs[i][0] + costs[i + costs.size()/2][1];
        }
        return res;
    }
};

  });
