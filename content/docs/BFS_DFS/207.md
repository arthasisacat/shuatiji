# 207. Course Schedule
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   
topological sort.

## Description
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 

Constraints:

The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
1 <= numCourses <= 10^5

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> g(numCourses); // node & its (going to/out) neighbors
        vector<int> indegree(numCourses, 0);
        for (auto p : prerequisites){
            indegree[p[0]]++;
            g[p[1]].push_back(p[0]);
        }
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++){
            if (indegree[i] == 0){
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        while (!q.empty()){
            int cur = q.front(); q.pop();
            for (auto child : g[cur]){
                if (indegree[child] == 0){
                    continue;
                }
                indegree[child] --;
                if (indegree[child] == 0){
                    q.push(child);
                }
            }
        }
        for (auto in : indegree){
            if (in != 0){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
