## Description
On a 2D plane, we place stones at some integer coordinate points.  Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

Now, a move consists of removing a stone that shares a column or row with another stone on the grid.

What is the largest possible number of moves we can make?

 

Example 1:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: stones = [[0,0]]
Output: 0
 

Note:

1 <= stones.length <= 1000
0 <= stones[i][j] < 10000

## Solution
Let's say stones in same rows or same columns are 'connected'. If `n` stones are connected with each other, the result of 'moving/clashing' them together will eventually result in 1 stone. Thus the number of moves is `n-1`. Also I *think* it's true that as long as each others are connected, they can always be merged to 1 stone. Why? I don't know, there might be some mathematical proof for it.

So this problem becomes 'counting how many islands we have' and the criteria for connecting lands in this problem is either in same row or same col. 

Writing it down is hard. So learn.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeStones(vector<vector<int>>& stones) {
        unordered_map<int,vector<int>> rows, cols;
        for (auto p : stones){
            rows[p[0]].push_back(p[1]);
            cols[p[1]].push_back(p[0]);
        }
        unordered_set<int> visited_row;
        int res = 0;
        for (auto r : rows){
            /* why dfs(visited_row, rows, cols, r.first) could be 0 and we need to use max(0, ...-1) to prevent it?
            because if that row was already visited, they should not contribute again so dfs() result should be 0. but we
            don't want res +=(-1) for sure.
            */
            res += max(0, (dfs(visited_row, rows, cols, r.first) - 1));
        }
        return res;
    }
    int dfs(unordered_set<int>& visited_row, unordered_map<int,vector<int>>& rows, unordered_map<int,vector<int>>& cols, int i){
        if (visited_row.count(i)){
            return 0;
        }
        int res = rows[i].size();
        visited_row.insert(i);
        for (auto c : rows[i]){
            for (auto r : cols[c]){
                res += dfs(visited_row, rows, cols, r);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
