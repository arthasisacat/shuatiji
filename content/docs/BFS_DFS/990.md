union find

## Description
Given an array equations of strings that represent relationships between variables, each string equations[i] has length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "a==b" or "a!=b".  Here, a and b are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return true if and only if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations.

 

Example 1:

Input: ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.  There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
Example 2:

Input: ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
Example 3:

Input: ["a==b","b==c","a==c"]
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: ["a==b","b!=c","c==a"]
Output: false
Example 5:

Input: ["c==c","b==d","x!=z"]
Output: true
 

Note:

1 <= equations.length <= 500
equations[i].length == 4
equations[i][0] and equations[i][3] are lowercase letters
equations[i][1] is either '=' or '!'
equations[i][2] is '='

## Solution

Union find. 

1. union all variables that are equal (`euqation.find('!') == string::npos`)
2. check non-equal equations, and make sure those variables pair does not have same parent.


```c++
class Solution {
private:
    vector<int> parent;
    void union_init(){
        parent.resize(26);
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++){
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }
public:
    char find(int c){
        while (c != parent[c]){
            parent[c] = parent[parent[c]];
            c = parent[c];
        }
        return c;
    }
    bool equationsPossible(vector<string>& equations) {
        union_init();
        
        // union == first. 
        for (auto eq : equations){
            if (eq.find('!') == string::npos){ // union
                parent[find(parent[eq[0]-'a'])] = find(parent[eq[3]-'a']);
            }
        }
        
        // check != 
        for (auto eq : equations){
            if (eq.find('!') != string::npos) { // expect them to be not in same group
                if (find(parent[eq[0]-'a']) == find(parent[eq[3]-'a'])){
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
