**notes**   


## Description
You are given a list of non-negative integers, a1, a2, ..., an, and a target, S. Now you have 2 symbols + and -. For each integer, you should choose one from + and - as its new symbol.

Find out how many ways to assign symbols to make sum of integers equal to target S.

Example 1:
Input: nums is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], S is 3. 
Output: 5
Explanation: 

-1+1+1+1+1 = 3
+1-1+1+1+1 = 3
+1+1-1+1+1 = 3
+1+1+1-1+1 = 3
+1+1+1+1-1 = 3

There are 5 ways to assign symbols to make the sum of nums be target 3.
Note:
The length of the given array is positive and will not exceed 20.
The sum of elements in the given array will not exceed 1000.
Your output answer is guaranteed to be fitted in a 32-bit integer.

## Solution
This problem is saying - pick some numbers as positive numbers, and rest as negative numbers, add them together, sum should be target. 

sum(P) - sum(N) = target (here N is for all negative numbers and extract '-' outside)

sum(P) - sum(N) + sum(P) + sum(N) = target + sum(P) + sum(N)

sum(P) * 2 = target + sum(ALL)

NOTE: (target + sum(ALL)) MUST be even number!

Now problem becomes, find how many ways to pick some numbers to form sum(P) so that `sum(P) = (target + sum(ALL))/2`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findTargetSumWays(vector<int>& nums, int S) {
        int res = 0;
        int sum = accumulate(nums.begin(), nums.end(),0);
        if (sum < S || (S+sum)%2 != 0){
            return 0;
        }
        int target = (S + sum)/2;
        dfs(nums, 0, target, res);
        return res;
    }
    void dfs(vector<int>& nums, int i, int target, int& res){
        if (i == nums.size()){
            if (target == 0){
                res++;
            }
            return;
        }
        dfs(nums, i+1, target, res);
        dfs(nums, i+1, target-nums[i], res);
    }
};
```
