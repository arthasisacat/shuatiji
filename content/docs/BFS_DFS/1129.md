## Description
Consider a directed graph, with nodes labelled 0, 1, ..., n-1.  In this graph, each edge is either red or blue, and there could be self-edges or parallel edges.

Each [i, j] in red_edges denotes a red directed edge from node i to node j.  Similarly, each [i, j] in blue_edges denotes a blue directed edge from node i to node j.

Return an array answer of length n, where each answer[X] is the length of the shortest path from node 0 to node X such that the edge colors alternate along the path (or -1 if such a path doesn't exist).

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, red_edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], blue_edges = []
Output: [0,1,-1]
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, red_edges = [[0,1]], blue_edges = [[2,1]]
Output: [0,1,-1]
Example 3:

Input: n = 3, red_edges = [[1,0]], blue_edges = [[2,1]]
Output: [0,-1,-1]
Example 4:

Input: n = 3, red_edges = [[0,1]], blue_edges = [[1,2]]
Output: [0,1,2]
Example 5:

Input: n = 3, red_edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], blue_edges = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1,1]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
red_edges.length <= 400
blue_edges.length <= 400
red_edges[i].length == blue_edges[i].length == 2
0 <= red_edges[i][j], blue_edges[i][j] < n

## Solution
It's easy to think of BFS.
But the hard part is to include both option (blue/red) into queue at the same time.
during BFS, even if the node has been visited, but if the node with that color is not visited, add it to queue. This way, we could get shortest path (because of using BFS) and reach to as many nodes as possible.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> shortestAlternatingPaths(int n, vector<vector<int>>& red_edges, vector<vector<int>>& blue_edges) {
        vector<vector<vector<int>>> g(2, vector<vector<int>>(n));
        for(auto e : red_edges){
            g[0][e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
        }
        for(auto e : blue_edges){
            g[1][e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
        }
        vector<vector<int>> d(n,vector<int>(2,INT_MAX));
        d[0][0] = 0;
        d[0][1] = 0;

        // key is to push node with both color into queue
        queue<pair<int,int>> q;
        q.push({0,0});
        q.push({0,1});
        while(!q.empty()){
            auto cur = q.front(); q.pop();
            int node = cur.first, color = cur.second;
            for(auto child : g[color][node]){
                if(d[child][1-color] == INT_MAX){
                    d[child][1-color] = d[node][color] + 1;
                    q.push({child,1-color});
                }
            }
        }
        vector<int> res(n);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            res[i] = min(d[i][0], d[i][1]) == INT_MAX ? -1 : min(d[i][0], d[i][1]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
