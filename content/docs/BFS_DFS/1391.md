## Description
Given a m x n grid. Each cell of the grid represents a street. The street of grid[i][j] can be:
1 which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
2 which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
3 which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
4 which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
5 which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
6 which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.


You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell (0,0). A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell (0,0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1). The path should only follow the streets.

Notice that you are not allowed to change any street.

Return true if there is a valid path in the grid or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).
Example 4:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,3]]
Output: true
Example 5:

Input: grid = [[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[6]]
Output: true
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6

## Solution

From [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-there-is-a-valid-path-in-a-grid/discuss/547225/C%2B%2B-with-picture%3A-track-direction-%2B-upscaled-grid):

You do not need to search for a path. You just follow the existing path until you can, and check if you reach your destination. The only variable here is your initial direction: e.g. if you start at a turn, you can go either down or right.

Let's define 4 directions: right (0), left (1), down (2) and up (3). Each road type can continue from some direction, and can change it to another direction. For example, for road type 3, you can continue from left, and it changes your direction to down. Or, you can continue from up and change to left. We track these rules in turns.

```c++
class Solution {
private:
                                                                     //. 0  1. 2. 3
    vector<vector<int>> dirs ={ {0,-1}, {0,1}, {-1,0}, {1,0} }; // order: l, r, u, d
    unordered_map<int,int> turns[7]{
        {},
        { {0,0}, {1,1} }, // street 1
        { {2,2}, {3,3} }, // street 2
        { {2,0}, {1,3} }, // street 3
        { {2,1}, {0,3} }, // street 4
        { {3,0}, {1,2} }, // street 5
        { {0,2}, {3,1} }  // street 6
    };
public:
    bool trace(vector<vector<int>>& g, int dir){
        int i = 0, j = 0, m = g.size(), n = g[0].size();
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && i < m && j < n){
            int road = g[i][j];
            if (!turns[road].count(dir)){
                // this check must be earlier than terminal check!!!
                // because if it's not acceptable if terminal is not qualified
                // e.g.[[1,1,2]]
                return false;
            }
            if (i == m-1 && j == n-1){
                return true;
            }
            dir = turns[road][dir];
            i += dirs[dir][0];
            j += dirs[dir][1];      
        }
        return false;
    }
    bool hasValidPath(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        return trace(grid, 0) || trace(grid, 1) || trace(grid,2) || trace(grid,3);
    }
};
```
