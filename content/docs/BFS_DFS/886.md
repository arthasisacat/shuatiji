## Description
Given a set of N people (numbered 1, 2, ..., N), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size.

Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group. 

Formally, if dislikes[i] = [a, b], it means it is not allowed to put the people numbered a and b into the same group.

Return true if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: true
Explanation: group1 [1,4], group2 [2,3]
Example 2:

Input: N = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: N = 5, dislikes = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[1,5]]
Output: false
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 2000
0 <= dislikes.length <= 10000
1 <= dislikes[i][j] <= N
dislikes[i][0] < dislikes[i][1]
There does not exist i != j for which dislikes[i] == dislikes[j].

## Solution
1. create graph to record dislike people for each person
2. dfs through all the person
   1. if the person does not have color, color it with group 1
   2. then dfs the person's disliked persons, and expecting they have opposite color, if they don't have color, colo them.
   3. if disliked person has same color as current person, then return false. 
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool possibleBipartition(int N, vector<vector<int>>& dislikes) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(N);
        vector<int> group(N, 0); //0: not visited, 1: group 1, 2: group2
        for (auto p : dislikes){
            graph[p[0]-1].push_back(p[1]-1);
            graph[p[1]-1].push_back(p[0]-1);
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            if (group[i] == 0){
                if (!dfs(graph, group, i, 1)){
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    // dfs from people i (0 index based) and try to color ii with assign_group.
    // also dfs all i's dislikes person.
    bool dfs(vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& group, int i, int assign_group){
        if (group[i] != 0){
            return group[i] == assign_group;
        }
        group[i] = assign_group;
        int next_lvl_grp = assign_group == 1 ? 2 : 1;
        for (auto dis : graph[i]){
            if (!dfs(graph, group, dis, next_lvl_grp)){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
