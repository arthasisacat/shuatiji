## Description
We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one letter string.

We are allowed to place any color block C on top of two adjacent blocks of colors A and B, if and only if ABC is an allowed triple.

We start with a bottom row of bottom, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples allowed. Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length 3.

Return true if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise false.

Example 1:

Input: bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCG", "CDE", "GEA", "FFF"]
Output: true
Explanation:
We can stack the pyramid like this:
    A
   / \
  G   E
 / \ / \
B   C   D

We are allowed to place G on top of B and C because BCG is an allowed triple.  Similarly, we can place E on top of C and D, then A on top of G and E.

Example 2:

Input: bottom = "AABA", allowed = ["AAA", "AAB", "ABA", "ABB", "BAC"]
Output: false
Explanation:
We can't stack the pyramid to the top.
Note that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.
 

Note:

bottom will be a string with length in range [2, 8].
allowed will have length in range [0, 200].
Letters in all strings will be chosen from the set {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}.

## Solution: DFS
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool pyramidTransition(string bottom, vector<string>& allowed) {
        unordered_map<string,vector<char>> dict;
        for (auto s : allowed){
            dict[s.substr(0,2)].push_back(s[2]);
        }
        return helper(bottom, 0, "", dict);
    }
    bool helper(string s, int start, string cur, unordered_map<string,vector<char>>& d){
        if (s.length() == 1){
            return true;
        }
        if ((start+1) == s.length()){ // AA: start stops at first A.
            return helper(cur, 0, "", d);
        }
        for(auto c : d[s.substr(start,2)]){
            if (helper(s, start+1, cur+c, d)){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;        
    }
};
```
