# 1162. As Far from Land as Possible
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/as-far-from-land-as-possible/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   


## Description
Given an N x N grid containing only values 0 and 1, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return the distance.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) is |x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|.

If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

 

Example 1:



Input: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
Example 2:



Input: [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
 

Note:

1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 100
grid[i][j] is 0 or 1

## Solution BFS and coloring

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    vector<vector<int>> dir = { {0,1}, {0,-1}, {1,0}, {-1,0} };
public:
    int maxDistance(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        queue<pair<int,int>> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++){
                if (grid[i][j] == 1){
                    q.push({i,j});
                }
            }
        }
        if (q.size() == (grid.size()*grid[0].size())){ // no zero
            return -1;
        }
        int lvl = 0;
        while (!q.empty()){
            int size = q.size();
            lvl ++;
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++){
                auto p = q.front(); q.pop();
                for (auto d : dir){
                    int x = p.first + d[0];
                    int y = p.second + d[1];
                    if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= grid.size() || y >= grid[0].size() || grid[x][y] > 0){
                        continue;
                    }
                    grid[x][y] = lvl+1;
                    q.push({x,y});
                }
            }
        }
        return lvl-1;
    }
};
