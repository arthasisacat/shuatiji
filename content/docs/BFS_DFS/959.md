# 959. Regions Cut By Slashes
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/regions-cut-by-slashes/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as "\\".)

Return the number of regions.

 

Example 1:

Input:
[
  " /",
  "/ "
]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 2:

Input:
[
  " /",
  "  "
]
Output: 1
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 3:

Input:
[
  "\\/",
  "/\\"
]
Output: 4
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 4:

Input:
[
  "/\\",
  "\\/"
]
Output: 5
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to /\, and "\\/" refers to \/.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 5:

Input:
[
  "//",
  "/ "
]
Output: 3
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

 

Note:

1 <= grid.length == grid[0].length <= 30
grid[i][j] is either '/', '\', or ' '.

 **especially for the explanation of why using 3*3 instead of 2*2!!!**
