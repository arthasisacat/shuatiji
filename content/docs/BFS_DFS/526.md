## Description
Suppose you have N integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these N numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the ith position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

The number at the ith position is divisible by i.
i is divisible by the number at the ith position.
 

Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
 

Note:

N is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.

## Solution: DFS
Swap as you can, then go forward. 
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countArrangement(int N) {
        vector<bool> used(N+1, false);
        return helper(1, N, used);
    }
    int helper(int cur, int N, vector<bool>& used){
        if (cur == (N+1)){
            return 1;
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
            if (used[i]){
                continue;
            }
            if (i%cur != 0 && cur%i != 0){
                continue;
            }
            used[i] = true;
            res += helper(cur+1, N, used);
            used[i] = false;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
