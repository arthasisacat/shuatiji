# 450. Delete Node in a BST
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4.5

**note**
自己写出来了哈哈. 不好写啊.

## Description
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

Example:

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

   / \
  2   6

    4   7

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* deleteNode(TreeNode* root, int key) {
        // make dummy root to make root no longer fatherless. :) 
        TreeNode* dummy = new TreeNode(0);
        dummy->left = root;
        
        // search for key, if exist node is the key, father is its father.
        TreeNode* father = dummy, *node = root;
        while(node){
            if (node->val == key){
                break;
            }
            else if (node->val > key){
                father = node;
                node = node->left;
            }
            else {
                father = node;
                node = node->right;
            }
        }
        if (!node){
            return root;
        }
        
        /* delete node. separate to 3 situations based on how many children node has:
         1. no children
         2. 1 and only 1 children
         3. both children */
        bool is_left_child = father->left == node;
        if (!node->left && !node->right){ // leaf
            if (is_left_child){
                father->left = nullptr;
            }
            else{
                father->right = nullptr;
            }
        }
        else if (!node->left || !node->right){ // has only one child
            if (is_left_child){
                father->left = node->left ? node->left : node->right;
            }
            else{
                father->right = node->left ? node->left : node->right;
            }
        }
        else{ // has 2 child
            /* go right, then left-left-left to left most child, use that `tmp` to replace node.
            Note that that `tmp` could have right children! */
            TreeNode* tmp = node->right;
            TreeNode* prev = nullptr;
            while (tmp->left){
                prev = tmp;
                tmp = tmp->left;
            }
            node->val = tmp->val;
            if (!prev){ // tmp = node->right
                node->right = tmp->right;
            }
            else {
                prev->left = tmp->right;
            }
        }
        return dummy->left;
    }
};
