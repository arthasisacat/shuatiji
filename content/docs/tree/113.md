# 113. Path Sum II
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
2

**note**
basic 

## Description
Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1
Return:

[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]

## Solution
side note:
I don't want nullptr as node to enter `helper()` because at beginning of helper()
I add cur[] to res. 
If I allow nullptr as node to enter helper, which is attempting (and sounds easier), a node has 2 nullptr child (meaning it's a leaf) will hit `helper()` twice. And we don't like that to happen.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> pathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        vector<int> cur;
        if (!root){
            return res;
        }
        helper(root, sum, cur, res);
        return res;
    }
    void helper(TreeNode* n, int sum, vector<int> cur, vector<vector<int>>& res){
        // make sure n is always valid!
        cur.push_back(n->val);
        sum -= n->val;
        if (!n->left && !n->right){
            if (sum == 0){
                res.push_back(cur);
            }
            return;
        }
        if (n->left){
            helper(n->left, sum, cur, res);
        }
        if (n->right){
            helper(n->right, sum, cur, res);
        }
    }
};
```
