# 1302. Deepest Leaves Sum
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/deepest-leaves-sum/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
2

**note**

## Description
Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.
 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]
Output: 15
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10^4.
The value of nodes is between 1 and 100.

## Solution: DFS
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    int max_h = 0;
    int res = 0;
public:
    int deepestLeavesSum(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root, 0);
        return res;
    }
    
    void dfs(TreeNode* n, int cur_h){
        if (!n){
            return;
        }
        cur_h ++;
        if (cur_h == max_h){
            res += n->val;
        }
        else if (cur_h > max_h){
            max_h = cur_h;
            res = n->val;
        }
        dfs(n->left, cur_h);
        dfs(n->right, cur_h);
        
    }
};
```

## Solution: BFS
we can use BFS as well : ) by level order traversal.
