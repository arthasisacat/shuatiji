# 1245. Tree Diameter

similar and harder compared to [543](/docs/543)

## Description
Given an undirected tree, return its diameter: the number of edges in a longest path in that tree.

The tree is given as an array of edges where edges[i] = [u, v] is a bidirectional edge between nodes u and v.  Each node has labels in the set {0, 1, ..., edges.length}.

 

Example 1:



Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
A longest path of the tree is the path 1 - 0 - 2.
Example 2:



Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
A longest path of the tree is the path 3 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5.
 

Constraints:

0 <= edges.length < 10^4
edges[i][0] != edges[i][1]
0 <= edges[i][j] <= edges.length
The given edges form an undirected tree.

## Solution
Note that `helper(0, -1, adjacent_list);` we use 0 as start 'root' node. Does it matter to use which node as start? NO. 
Note that we use 'father' node to make sure we don't go back to visited nodes. 

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    int res = 0;
public:
    int treeDiameter(vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        int n = edges.size()+1;
        vector<vector<int>> adjacent_list(n+1);
        for (auto e : edges){
            adjacent_list[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adjacent_list[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        helper(0, -1, adjacent_list);
        return res-1;
    }
    int helper(int node, int parent, vector<vector<int>>& l){
        int max1 = 0, max2 = 0;
        for (auto neighbor : l[node]){
            if (neighbor == parent){
                continue;
            }
            int d = helper(neighbor, node, l);
            if (d >= max1){
                max2 = max1; 
                max1 = d;
            }
            else if (d > max2){
                max2 = d;
            }            
        }
        res = max(res, max1 + max2 + 1);
        return 1 + max(max1, max2);
    }
};
```
