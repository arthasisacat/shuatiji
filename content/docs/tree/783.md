# 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes

same as [530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/)

**difficulty(1-5)**

**note**

## Description
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Example :

Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
Note:

The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.

## Solution
in order traversal 

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int minDiffInBST(TreeNode* root) {
        int res = INT_MAX;
        stack<TreeNode*> s;
        TreeNode* p = root;
        int prev; // prev's node's value
        bool is_first_node = true;
        while (!s.empty() || p) {
            while (p) {
                s.push(p);
                p = p->left;
            }
            if (!s.empty()){
                p = s.top(); s.pop();
                
                if (is_first_node) {
                    is_first_node = false;
                }
                else {
                    res = min(res, p->val - prev);
                }
                prev = p->val;
                p = p->right;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
