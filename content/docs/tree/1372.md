# 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
3

**note**

## Description
Given a binary tree root, a ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:

Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
If the current direction is right then move to the right child of the current node otherwise move to the left child.
Change the direction from right to left or right to left.
Repeat the second and third step until you can't move in the tree.
Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).

Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [1,null,1,1,1,null,null,1,1,null,1,null,null,null,1,null,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (right -> left -> right).
Example 2:



Input: root = [1,1,1,null,1,null,null,1,1,null,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Longest ZigZag path in blue nodes (left -> right -> left -> right).
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

Each tree has at most 50000 nodes..
Each node's value is between [1, 100].

## Solution
```
.f : .first
.s : .second

            cur 
 cur.f--> /      \  <--cur.s
         l        r
        / \      /  \ 
        \  l.s   \  /
        /       r.f \
       l.f           /
                    r.s

```
use helper to do dfs, key is to use `pair<int,int>` to record left and right tree's zigzag max length. (that must start with left and right node).
then, for current node, it's longest len is either 
 cur + left child => cur.first = 1+l.second (left child has to choose left child + its right subtree)
 OR
 cur + right child => cur.second = 1 + r.first (right child + its left subtree)


remember to return res-1 because res is number of nodes, problem asks for number of edges. 

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    int res = 0;
public:
    pair<int,int> helper(TreeNode* n){
        pair<int,int> cur = make_pair(0,0);
        if (!n){
            return cur;
        }
        auto l = helper(n->left);
        auto r = helper(n->right);
        cur.first = 1 + l.second;
        cur.second = 1 + r.first;
        res = max({res, cur.first, cur.second});
        return cur;
    }
    int longestZigZag(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root){
            return 0;
        }
        helper(root);
        return res-1;
    }
};
```
