# 1120. Maximum Average Subtree
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subtree/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
3

**note**

## Description
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)

 

Example 1:



Input: [5,6,1]
Output: 6.00000
Explanation: 
For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.
For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.
For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.
So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.
 

Note:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 5000.
Each node will have a value between 0 and 100000.
Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within 10^-5 of the correct answer.

## Solution
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    double res;
public:
    double maximumAverageSubtree(TreeNode* root) {
        res = -1.0; // because all nodes's value >= 0
        dfs(root);
        return res;
    }
    // return sum, cnt of n's subtree (including n)
    pair<int,int> dfs(TreeNode* n){
        if (!n){
            return {0,0};
        }
        auto l = dfs(n->left);
        auto r = dfs(n->right);
        int sum = l.first + r.first + n->val;
        int cnt = l.second + r.second + 1;
        res = max(res, (double)sum/cnt);
        return {sum,cnt};
    }
};
```
