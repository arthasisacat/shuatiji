# 1273. Delete Tree Nodes
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-tree-nodes/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4

**note**
自己做出来了哈哈哈？

## Description
A tree rooted at node 0 is given as follows:

The number of nodes is nodes;
The value of the i-th node is value[i];
The parent of the i-th node is parent[i].
Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.

After doing so, return the number of nodes remaining in the tree.

 

Example 1:



Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2], value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-1]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= nodes <= 10^4
-10^5 <= value[i] <= 10^5
parent.length == nodes
parent[0] == -1 which indicates that 0 is the root.

## Solution
```c++
class node{
public:
    int val;
    vector<node*> children;
    node(int v=0){
        this->val = v;
    }
};
class Solution {
public:
    pair<int,int> helper(node* n, int& res){
        if (!n){
            return {0,0};
        }
        int sum = n->val, cnt = 1;
        for (auto c : n->children){
            auto tmp = helper(c, res);
            sum += tmp.first;
            cnt += tmp.second;
        }
        if (sum == 0){
            res -= cnt;
            return {0,0};
        }
        return {sum, cnt};
    }
    int deleteTreeNodes(int nodes, vector<int>& parent, vector<int>& value) {
        // 1. build tree. (note that once built, tree[] is useless)
        node* root = new node();
        vector<node*> tree(nodes,nullptr);
        tree[0] = root;
        for (int i = 1; i < nodes;i++){
            node* cur = new node(value[i]);
            tree[i] = cur;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < nodes; i++){
            tree[parent[i]]->children.push_back(tree[i]);
        }
        
        // 2. delete subtrees cnt whose sum is 0. I didn't delete node, just update the count.
        int res = nodes;
        helper(root, res);
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
