# 648. Replace Words
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
3

**note**

## Description
In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, the root an, followed by other, which can form another word another.

Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successor in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor has many roots can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

You need to output the sentence after the replacement.

Example 1:

Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
 

Note:

The input will only have lower-case letters.
1 <= dict words number <= 1000
1 <= sentence words number <= 1000
1 <= root length <= 100
1 <= sentence words length <= 1000

## Solution
```c++
class node {
public:
    bool is_root;
    vector<node*> children;
    node(){
        this->is_root = false;
        this->children.assign(26, nullptr);
    }
};
class Solution {
private:
    node* head = nullptr;
    
    void insert_to_trie(node* h, string s){
        node* cur = h;
        for (auto c : s){
            if (!cur->children[c-'a']){
                cur->children[c-'a'] = new node();
            }
            cur = cur->children[c-'a'];
        }
        cur->is_root = true;
    }

public:
    string replaceWords(vector<string>& dict, string sentence) {
        head = new node();
        for (auto root : dict){
            insert_to_trie(head, root);
        }
        
        istringstream iss(sentence);
        string res;
        string tmp;
        while (iss >> tmp){
            node* cur = head;
            int len = 0;
            for (auto c : tmp){
                if (!cur->children[c-'a']){
                    break;
                }
                cur = cur->children[c-'a'];
                len++;
                if (cur->is_root){
                    res += tmp.substr(0,len) + " ";
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!cur->is_root){
                res += tmp + " ";
            }
        }
        res.pop_back();
        return res;
    }
};
```
