# 671. Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-node-in-a-binary-tree/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
3

**note**

## Description
Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val) always holds.

Given such a binary tree, you need to output the second minimum value in the set made of all the nodes' value in the whole tree.

If no such second minimum value exists, output -1 instead.

Example 1:

Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   5
     / \
    5   7

Output: 5
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, the second smallest value is 5.
 

Example 2:

Input: 
    2
   / \
  2   2

Output: -1
Explanation: The smallest value is 2, but there isn't any second smallest value.

## Solution
In the problem, only thing we are sure is root is the smallest node. No other info 
is known. 
**
Thus this problem becomes: find smallest node in this tree but it's val cannot be root->val.
**
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private: 
    bool found = false;
public:
    int findSecondMinimumValue(TreeNode* root) {
        int cur = INT_MAX;
        helper(root, cur, root->val);
        return found ? cur : -1;
    }
    // search for min, but this min cannot be root_val
    void helper(TreeNode* n, int& cur_min, int root_val){
        if (!n){
            return;
        }
        if (n->val <= cur_min && n->val != root_val){
            cur_min = n->val;
            found = true;
        }
        helper(n->left, cur_min, root_val);
        helper(n->right, cur_min, root_val);
    }
};
```
