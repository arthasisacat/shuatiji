**difficulty(1-5)**

**note**

## Description
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

Example:

root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11

## Solution

dfs inside dfs.

1. outer: number of paths that qualify, start from every node.
2. inner: for given starting node, number of paths that qualifies.

    }
    int helper(TreeNode* root, int target){
        if (!root){
            return 0;
        }
        target -= root->val;
        return (target == 0 ? 1 : 0) + helper(root->left, target) + helper(root->right, target);
        
    }
