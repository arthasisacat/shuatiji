# 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

**note**

## Description
Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],

   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
 

return [2].

Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

## Solution
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    vector<int> res;
    int pre_val, max_cnt, cur_cnt;
public:
    vector<int> findMode(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root);
        return res;
    }
    // inorder
    void helper(TreeNode* n) {
        if (!n) {
            return;
        }
        helper(n->left);
        if (n->val != pre_val){
            pre_val = n->val;
            cur_cnt = 1;
        }
        else {
            cur_cnt ++;
        }
        if (cur_cnt > max_cnt) {
            res.clear();
            res.push_back(n->val);
            max_cnt = cur_cnt;
        }
        else if (cur_cnt == max_cnt){
            res.push_back(n->val);
        }
        helper(n->right);        
    }
    
};
```
