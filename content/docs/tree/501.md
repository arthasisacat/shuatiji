**note**

## Description
Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

For example:
Given BST [1,null,2,2],

   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
 

return [2].

Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

## Solution
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

public:
    vector<int> findMode(TreeNode* root) {

        return res;
    }
    
    // in order
    void helper(TreeNode* root){
        if (!root){
            return;
        }
        //left
        helper(root->left);
        
        // process current node
        if (root->val != prev_val){
            cur_cnt = 1;
        }
        else{
            cur_cnt ++;
        }
        if (cur_cnt > max_cnt){
            max_cnt = cur_cnt;
            res.clear();
            res.push_back(root->val);
        }
        else if (cur_cnt == max_cnt){
            res.push_back(root->val);
        }
        prev_val = root->val;
        
        //right
        helper(root->right);
    }
};
