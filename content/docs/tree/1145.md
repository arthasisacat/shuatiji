brain teaser?

## Description
Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.

Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y blue.

Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)

If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.

You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true.  If it is not possible, return false.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], n = 11, x = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The second player can choose the node with value 2.
 

Constraints:

root is the root of a binary tree with n nodes and distinct node values from 1 to n.
n is odd.
1 <= x <= n <= 100

## Solution
```c++
/*    root
      /  \
    [x]   /\
    / \
    
 If player 1 chooses x, then it has 3 directions - left , right, parent.
 count number of each direction.
 Player 2 has to choose the max count direction, and place her first color right next to 
 player 1's first color. 
 that way, player 2 can and only can occupies that 'branch'. Player 1 takes the rest.
 so:
 left + right + 1 + parent = n
 (1 is x)
 
 Player 2 choose maximum of {left, right, n-left-right-1}, and player 1 takes the rest.

class Solution {
private:
    int left, right;
public:
    /* return node counts whose root is `n`. if n == target, then save its left
     and right subtree counts to `left` and `right`
     */
    int count(TreeNode* n, int target){
        if (!n){
            return 0;
        }
        int l = count(n->left, target);
        int r = count(n->right, target);
        if (n->val == target){
            left = l;
            right = r;
        }
        return l + r + 1;
    }
    
    bool btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode* root, int n, int x) {
        count(root, x);
        int player_choose = max({left, right, n-left-right-1});
        return player_choose > (n-player_choose-1);
    }
};
```
