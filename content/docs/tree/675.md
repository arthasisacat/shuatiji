# 675. Cut Off Trees for Golf Event
[https://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/](https://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/)

## Description
You are asked to cut off trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as a non-negative 2D map, in this map:

0 represents the obstacle can't be reached.
1 represents the ground can be walked through.
The place with number bigger than 1 represents a tree can be walked through, and this positive number represents the tree's height.
 

You are asked to cut off all the trees in this forest in the order of tree's height - always cut off the tree with lowest height first. And after cutting, the original place has the tree will become a grass (value 1).

You will start from the point (0, 0) and you should output the minimum steps you need to walk to cut off all the trees. If you can't cut off all the trees, output -1 in that situation.

You are guaranteed that no two trees have the same height and there is at least one tree needs to be cut off.

Example 1:
```
Input: 
[
 [1,2,3],
 [0,0,4],
 [7,6,5]
]
Output: 6
```

Example 2:
```
Input: 
[
 [1,2,3],
 [0,0,0],
 [7,6,5]
]
Output: -1
```

Example 3:
```
Input: [

 [2,3,4],
 [0,0,5],
 [8,7,6]
]
Output: 6
Explanation: You started from the point (0,0) and you can cut off the tree in (0,0) directly without walking.
```
Hint: size of the given matrix will not exceed 50x50.

## Solution
100% 确信自己的 code 没问题但是 leetcode 就是报 TLE (time limit exceeded) 明明和[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/cut-off-trees-for-golf-event/discuss/107403/C%2B%2B-Sort-%2B-BFS-with-explanation) 写的一摸一样啊 😂
Anyway 思路为:
1. sort all trees' positions in ascending order using vector<vector<int>> where every line we could put height as first element,
followed by x, y, thus we could use sort() function directly
1. visit tree in order, for every visit:
    - use bfs to calculate distance from start point to destination point (in the beginning start point is [0,0])
    - if destination can be reached, add distance to res, otherwise return -1.
    - set destination point as new start point, go to next loop.

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    vector<vector<int>> dir = { {0,1}, {0,-1}, {1,0}, {-1,0} };
public:
    // return min dist (cost) to go from [start_x, start_y] to [x,y]
    // can only go through grid that is 1 (grass)/ >1 (tree)
    // return -1 if cannot be reached.
    int bfs(vector<vector<int>>& forest, int start_x, int start_y, int x, int y) {
        forest[x][y] = 1;
        if (start_x == x && start_y == y) {
            return 0;
        }
        int m = forest.size();
        int n = forest[0].size();
        int steps = 0;
        queue<pair<int,int>> q;
        q.push({start_x, start_y});
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        visited[start_x][start_y] = true;
        while (!q.empty()){
            int size = q.size();
            steps++;
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++){
                pair cur = q.front(); q.pop();
                for (auto d : dir) {
                    int i = cur.first + d[0];
                    int j = cur.second + d[1];
                    if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n
                       || forest[i][j] < 1 || visited[i][j]) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    if (i == x && j == y) {
                        return steps;
                    }                    
                    visited[i][j] = true;
                    q.push({i,j});
                }
            }
        }        
        return -1;
    }
    int cutOffTree(vector<vector<int>>& forest) {
        vector<vector<int>> trees; // saving positions of trees (height, i,j)
        int m = forest.size();
        int n = forest[0].size();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (forest[i][j] > 1) {
                    trees.push_back({forest[i][j], i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        sort(trees.begin(), trees.end()); // will sort by height by default
        int res = 0;
        int start_x = 0, start_y = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < trees.size(); i++) {
            int dist = bfs(forest, start_x, start_y, trees[i][1], trees[i][2]);
            if (dist == -1) {
                return -1; // cannot reach
            }
            res += dist;
            start_x = trees[i][1];
            start_y = trees[i][2];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
