## Description

For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs). Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list of their root labels.

Format
The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of labels).

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

Example 1 :

Input: n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]

        0
        |
        1
       / \
      2   3 

Output: [1]
Example 2 :

Input: n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]

     0  1  2
      \ | /
        3
        |
        4
        |
        5 

Output: [3, 4]
Note:

According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”
The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

## Solution TLE

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> g(n, vector<int>(n, -1));
        int shortest = INT_MAX;
        vector<int> res;
        for(auto e: edges){
            g[e[0]][e[1]] = 1;
            g[e[1]][e[0]] = 1;
        }
        for(int i = 0;i < n; i++){
            g[i][i] = 0;
            queue<int> q;
            vector<bool> visited(n, false);
            visited[i] = true;
            q.push(i);
            int d = 0;
            while(!q.empty()){
                int size = q.size();
                d++;
                for(int k = 0; k < size; k++){
                    int cur = q.front(); q.pop();
                    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                        if(!visited[j] && g[j][cur] == 1){
                            q.push(j);
                            visited[j] = true;
                        }
                    }                    
                }
            }
            if (d < shortest){
                shortest = d;
                res.clear();
                res.push_back(i);
            }
            else if (d == shortest){
                res.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2: 

Reduce leaf nodes from outer layer to inner layer, until there is at most 2 nodes left. 

use `degree[]` to know if nodes are leaves. (like indegree, outdegree, except in this problem it's undirectional graph)

Note: push leaf and isolated node to `q` like this `degree[i] <= 1`. 
These nodes are the ones that get deleted in first round!

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj_list(n);
        vector<int> degree(n, 0);
        vector<int> res;
        for(auto e : edges){
            adj_list[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            adj_list[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
            degree[e[0]]++;
            degree[e[1]]++;            
        }
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(degree[i] <= 1){
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        while(n > 2){
            int leaf_size = q.size();
            n -= leaf_size;
            for(int i = 0; i < leaf_size; i++){
                int cur = q.front(); q.pop();
                for(auto neighbor : adj_list[cur]){
                    --degree[neighbor];
                    if(degree[neighbor] == 1){
                        q.push(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        while(!q.empty()){
            res.push_back(q.front());
            q.pop();
        }
        return res;
    }
};
