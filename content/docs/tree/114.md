# 114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
3

**note**

## Description
Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
The flattened tree should look like:

1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6

HINT:

If you notice carefully in the flattened tree, each node's right child points to the next node of a pre-order traversal.

## Solution 1: recursive, easy
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root){
            return;
        }
        flatten(root->left);
        flatten(root->right);
        TreeNode* old_right = root->right;
        root->right = root->left;
        root->left = nullptr;
        while (root->right){
            root= root->right;
        }
        root->right = old_right;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2: non-recursive
```c++
/* See https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/discuss/37010/Share-my-simple-NON-recursive-solution-O(1)-space-complexity!
non recursive solution. So hard...
*/
class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode* cur = root;
        while (cur){
            if (cur->left){
                TreeNode* pre = cur->left;
                while (pre->right){
                    pre = pre->right;
                }
                pre->right = cur->right;
                
                cur->right = cur->left;
                cur->left = nullptr;
            }
            cur = cur->right;
        }
    }
};
```
