# 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4

**note**

## Description
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value V for which there exists different nodes A and B where V = |A.val - B.val| and A is an ancestor of B.

(A node A is an ancestor of B if either: any child of A is equal to B, or any child of A is an ancestor of B.)

 

Example 1:



Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are given below :
|8 - 3| = 5
|3 - 7| = 4
|8 - 1| = 7
|10 - 13| = 3
Among all possible differences, the maximum value of 7 is obtained by |8 - 1| = 7.
 

Note:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 2 and 5000.
Each node will have value between 0 and 100000.

## Solution
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    int res = 0;
public:
    int maxAncestorDiff(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root);
        return res;
    }
    pair<int,int> helper(TreeNode* n){
        if (!n->left && !n->right){
            return {n->val, n->val};
        }
        pair<int,int> l = {INT_MAX, INT_MIN}, r= {INT_MAX, INT_MIN};
        if (n->left){
            l = helper(n->left);
            res = max(res, abs(l.first - n->val));
            res = max(res, abs(l.second - n->val));
        }
        if (n->right){
            r = helper(n->right);
            res = max(res, abs(r.first - n->val));
            res = max(res, abs(r.second - n->val));
        }
        return {min({n->val, l.first, r.first}), max({n->val, l.second, r.second})};
    }
};
```
