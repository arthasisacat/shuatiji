# 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4

**note**

## Description
Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

Example 1:

Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
Example 2:

Input: 

          1
         /  
        3    
       / \       
      5   3     

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).
Example 3:

Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2 
       /        
      5      

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).
Example 4:

Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2
       /     \  
      5       9 
     /         \
    6           7
Output: 8
Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).


Note: Answer will in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

## Solution

Note that "the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation", thus we could treat the tree as if it's full tree and give each node (exist or nullptr) a unique ID. record the left most and right most ID. difference between them is the distance.

`// -ids[lvl].first*2 : for overflow prevention`
: why we cannot use ids.back().first here? Because we'll go to left subtree first, where ids' size is going to be enlarged. then we come back to current root node, go to right subtree. if we now use ids.back().first for right subtree, current `ids.back()` is actually different from the original `ids[lvl]`

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

    int widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {

        dfs(root, 0, 1, ids);
        
        int res = 0;
        for(auto p : ids){
            res = max(res, (int)(p.second - p.first+1));
        }
        return res;
    }
    void dfs(TreeNode* n, int lvl, int i, vector<pair<int,int>>& ids){
        if(!n){
            return;
        }
        if (ids.size() == lvl){ // n is left most node (aka first node) in this level
            ids.push_back({i,i});
        }
        else{ // for not left most node, always update .second every time
            ids[lvl].second = i;
        }
        // -ids[lvl].first*2 : for overflow prevention
        dfs(n->left, lvl+1, i*2-ids[lvl].first*2, ids);
        dfs(n->right, lvl+1, i*2+1-ids[lvl].first*2, ids);
    }
};
