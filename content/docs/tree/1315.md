# 1315. Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-nodes-with-even-valued-grandparent/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4

**note**

## Description
Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent.  (A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.)

If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10^4.
The value of nodes is between 1 and 100.

## Solution
*hint*

Father will become grandfather is we go one level down the node.  :) 


```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    int res = 0;
public:
    int sumEvenGrandparent(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root, false, false);
        return res;
    }
    
    void helper(TreeNode* n, bool even_father, bool even_grand) {
        if (!n){
            return;
        }
        if (even_grand){
            res += n->val;
        }
        bool is_even = (n->val%2 == 0);
        helper(n->left, is_even, even_father);
        helper(n->right, is_even, even_father);
    }
};
```
