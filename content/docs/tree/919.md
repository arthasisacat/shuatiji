# 919. Complete Binary Tree Inserter
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/complete-binary-tree-inserter/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4

**note**

## Description
A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Write a data structure CBTInserter that is initialized with a complete binary tree and supports the following operations:

CBTInserter(TreeNode root) initializes the data structure on a given tree with head node root;
CBTInserter.insert(int v) will insert a TreeNode into the tree with value node.val = v so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the inserted TreeNode;
CBTInserter.get_root() will return the head node of the tree.
 

Example 1:

Input: inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","get_root"], inputs = [[[1]],[2],[]]
Output: [null,1,[1,2]]
Example 2:

Input: inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","insert","get_root"], inputs = [[[1,2,3,4,5,6]],[7],[8],[]]
Output: [null,3,4,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]]
 

Note:

The initial given tree is complete and contains between 1 and 1000 nodes.
CBTInserter.insert is called at most 10000 times per test case.
Every value of a given or inserted node is between 0 and 5000.
 

## Solution
Thoughts:
1. What is the special thing about *complete* binary tree? - if we put them in level order to an array, node i's left and right children's index is 2*i+1 & 2*i+2!

```
      0
    1   2
   3 4 5 6
```
learn how to put a complete binary tree to the array below!!!

2. How to insert a new node to the end of the complete binary tree?
 First, insert it into the end of array for sure. then, link it to it's predecessor. 
 To find predecessor, because `i`'s left and right child is `2i+1` and `2i+2`, then if new node's index is `x`, then it's parent is `(x-1)/2`


```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class CBTInserter {
private:
    vector<TreeNode*> arr;
public:
    CBTInserter(TreeNode* root) {
        // BFS. put all notes by level order to arr.
        arr.push_back(root);
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++){ //< array size is expanding!!!
            if (arr[i]->left){
                arr.push_back(arr[i]->left);
            }
            if (arr[i]->right){
                arr.push_back(arr[i]->right);
            }
        }
    }
    
    int insert(int v) {
        int n = arr.size();
        TreeNode* node = new TreeNode(v);
        arr.push_back(node);
        if (n%2){
            arr[(n-1)/2]->left = node;
        }
        else{
            arr[(n-1)/2]->right = node;
        }
        return arr[(n-1)/2]->val;
    }
    
    TreeNode* get_root() {
        return arr[0];
    }
};

/**
 * Your CBTInserter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * CBTInserter* obj = new CBTInserter(root);
 * int param_1 = obj->insert(v);
 * TreeNode* param_2 = obj->get_root();
 */
