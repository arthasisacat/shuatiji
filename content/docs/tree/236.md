# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4

**note**

## Description
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]


 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
 
**
Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.
**
## Solution
Solution is based on the fact that `p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.`! Otherwise it doesn't work!!!
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        return helper(root, p, q);
    }
    // return {has_p, has_q}
    TreeNode* helper(TreeNode* n, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q){
        if (!n){
            return nullptr;
        }
        if (n == p || n == q){
            return n;
        }
        TreeNode* l = helper(n->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* r = helper(n->right, p, q);
        if (l && r) {
            return n;
        }
        return l ? l : r;
    }
    
};
```
