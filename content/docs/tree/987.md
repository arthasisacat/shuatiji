# 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree 

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/vertical-order-traversal-of-a-binary-tree/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3.5

**notes**   


## Description

Given a binary tree, return the vertical order traversal of its nodes values.

For each node at position (X, Y), its left and right children respectively will be at positions (X-1, Y-1) and (X+1, Y-1).

Running a vertical line from X = -infinity to X = +infinity, whenever the vertical line touches some nodes, we report the values of the nodes in order from top to bottom (decreasing Y coordinates).

If two nodes have the same position, then the value of the node that is reported first is the value that is smaller.

Return an list of non-empty reports in order of X coordinate.  Every report will have a list of values of nodes.

 

Example 1:



Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[9],[3,15],[20],[7]]
Explanation: 
Without loss of generality, we can assume the root node is at position (0, 0):
Then, the node with value 9 occurs at position (-1, -1);
The nodes with values 3 and 15 occur at positions (0, 0) and (0, -2);
The node with value 20 occurs at position (1, -1);
The node with value 7 occurs at position (2, -2).
Example 2:



Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [[4],[2],[1,5,6],[3],[7]]
Explanation: 
The node with value 5 and the node with value 6 have the same position according to the given scheme.
However, in the report "[1,5,6]", the node value of 5 comes first since 5 is smaller than 6.
 

Note:

The tree will have between 1 and 1000 nodes.
Each node's value will be between 0 and 1000.
 

## Solution

preorder traversal.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> verticalTraversal(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        map<int,map<int,set<int>>> m; // x - y - vals
        if (!root){
            return res;
        }
        helper(m, root, 0, 0);
        for(auto x : m){
            res.push_back({});
            for(auto y : x.second){
            //     for(auto num : y.second){
            //         res.back().push_back(num);
            //     }
                
            //OR
                res.back().insert(end(res.back()), begin(y.second), end(y.second));
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    void helper(map<int,map<int,set<int>>>& m, TreeNode* n, int x, int y){
        if (!n){
            return;
        }
        m[x][y].insert(n->val);
        helper(m, n->left, x-1, y+1);
        helper(m, n->right, x+1, y+1);
    }
};
```
