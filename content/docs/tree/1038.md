# 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search-tree-to-greater-sum-tree/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4

**note**

## Description
Given the root of a binary search tree with distinct values, modify it so that every node has a new value equal to the sum of the values of the original tree that are greater than or equal to node.val.

As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 

Example 1:



Input: [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
Output: [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 100.
Each node will have value between 0 and 100.
The given tree is a binary search tree.
Note: This question is the same as 538: https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree/

## Solution

从最大值到最小值依次访问。所以就用stack～

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* bstToGst(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root){
            return nullptr;
        }
        stack<TreeNode*> stk;
        TreeNode* p = root;
        int sum = 0;
        while (p || !stk.empty()){
            while (p) {
                stk.push(p);
                p = p->right;
            }
            if (!stk.empty()){
                p = stk.top();
                stk.pop();
                p->val += sum;
                sum = p->val;
                p = p->left;
            }            
        }
        return root;
    }
};
```
