## Description
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Solution
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private: 
    int longest = 0;
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root){
            // special case!!!
            return 0;
        }
        helper(root);
        return longest - 1; // longest is # of nodes, we need to return length = longest - 1
    }
    int helper(TreeNode* n){
        if (!n) {
            return 0;
        }
        int l = helper(n->left);
        int r = helper(n->right);
        longest = max(longest, l+r+1);
        return 1 + max(r, l);
    }
};
```
