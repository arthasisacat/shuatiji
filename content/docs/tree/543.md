## Description
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
```
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

## Solution

Let's first clarify, in this problem, the height I refer to is including the nodes. 0 node has 0 height, 1 node with no child has 1 height. 

For each node, we want to know its left tree's height `l` and right tree's height `r`. a path could be from (some) leaf from left subtree, through cur node, to (some) leaf from right subtree. This path has `l+r+1` nodes. But question is asking for the "length" which is the edges. Thus length of this path is `l+r`.

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };

        return res;
    }
    
    // return largest height from current root to its farest leaf
    int helper(TreeNode* root){
        if (!root){
            return 0;
        }
        int l = helper(root->left);
        int r = helper(root->right);
        
        // update res here, but it's NOT the one that get returned
        res = max(res, l+r);

        return max(l,r)+1;
    }
};
