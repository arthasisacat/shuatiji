分层遍历tree的基础写法

## Description
Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.
Example 1:
Input:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
Explanation:
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
Note:
The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

## Solution
note that sum needs to be long to prevent overflow when summing up.

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    vector<double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<double> res;
        if (!root) {
            return res;
        }
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            long sum = 0; // prevent overflow!!!!
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode* cur = q.front(); q.pop();
                sum += cur->val;
                if (cur->left) {
                    q.push(cur->left);
                }
                if (cur->right) {
                    q.push(cur->right);
                }
            }
            res.push_back((double)sum / size);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
