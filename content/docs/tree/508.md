# 508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-frequent-subtree-sum/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
3

**note**

## Description
Given the root of a tree, you are asked to find the most frequent subtree sum. The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself). So what is the most frequent subtree sum value? If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

Examples 1
Input:

  5
 /  \
2   -3
return [2, -3, 4], since all the values happen only once, return all of them in any order.
Examples 2
Input:

  5
 /  \
2   -5
return [2], since 2 happens twice, however -5 only occur once.
Note: You may assume the sum of values in any subtree is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

## Solution
Easy. Use hash map to save sum and its freq. 
Only trick to notice is keep track of max sum ever seen so that at the end, we can go over the map and only add those whose prequency match max sum. 

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
private:
    unordered_map<int,int> m; // sum - freq
    int max_cnt = 0;
public:
    vector<int> findFrequentTreeSum(TreeNode* root) {
        helper(root);
        vector<int> res;
        for(auto [sum,freq] : m){
            if (freq == max_cnt){
                res.push_back(sum);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    int helper(TreeNode* n){
        if (!n){
            return 0;
        }
        int sum = helper(n->left) + helper(n->right) + n->val;
        m[sum]++;
        max_cnt = max(max_cnt, m[sum]);
        return sum;        
    }
};
```
