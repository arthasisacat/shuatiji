# 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-level-sum-of-a-binary-tree/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
2

**note**

## Description
Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level X such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level X is maximal.

 

Example 1:



Input: [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.
 

Note:

The number of nodes in the given tree is between 1 and 10^4.
-10^5 <= node.val <= 10^5

## Solution
BFS, traverse by level.

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLevelSum(TreeNode* root) {
        int lvl = 1;
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        int max_sum = INT_MIN;
        int res = 0;
        while (!q.empty()){
            int size = q.size();
            int level_sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < size;i++){
                TreeNode* cur = q.front();
                q.pop();
                level_sum += cur->val;
                if (cur->left) {
                    q.push(cur->left);
                }
                if (cur->right){
                    q.push(cur->right);
                }
            }
            if (level_sum > max_sum){
                max_sum = level_sum;
                res = lvl;
            }
            lvl++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
