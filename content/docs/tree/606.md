## Description
You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way.

The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()". And you need to omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

Example 1:
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
   /    
  4     

Output: "1(2(4))(3)"

Explanation: Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", 
but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. 
And it will be "1(2(4))(3)".
Example 2:
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4]
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \  
      4 

Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"

Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, 
except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.

## Solution

Assume we have correct answer from left and right subtree, called `l` and `r`.

Consider 4 situations: (3rd and 4th can be combined)
1. !l && !r
2. l && !r : just add `()` for `l`
3. (l || !l) && r : doesn't matter if l is null or not, l needs `()`. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string tree2str(TreeNode* t) {
        if (!t){
            return "";
        }
        string l = tree2str(t->left);
        string r = tree2str(t->right);
        
        string res = to_string(t->val);
        // for !l && !r situation, res = to_string(t->val) does not need to be changed.
        
        if (r.length()== 0 && l.length() > 0){
            res += "(" + l + ")";
        }
        else if (r.length() > 0) {
            res = to_string(t->val) + "(" + l  + ")"+ "(" + r + ")";
        }
        // cout<<"cur node: "<<t->val<<"  : "<<res<<endl;
        return res;
    }
};
```
