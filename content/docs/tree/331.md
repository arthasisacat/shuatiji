# 331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree

**difficulty(1-5)**

**note**

## Description
One way to serialize a binary tree is to use pre-order traversal. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as #.

     _9_
    /   \
   3     2
  / \   / \
 4   1  #  6
/ \ / \   / \
# # # #   # #
For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#", where # represents a null node.

Given a string of comma separated values, verify whether it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree. Find an algorithm without reconstructing the tree.

Each comma separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character '#' representing null pointer.

You may assume that the input format is always valid, for example it could never contain two consecutive commas such as "1,,3".

Example 1:

Input: "9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "1,#"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: "9,#,#,1"
Output: false

## Solution 1
`diff = outdegree - indegree`

1. no matter what the node is (null or not null), we consume 1 indegree
2. if node is not null, it generate 2 outdegree
3. at any time, out >= in
4. at last, out = in, thus diff = 0

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidSerialization(string preorder) {
        int diff = 1; // out - in
        istringstream iss(preorder);
        string node;
        while(getline(iss, node, ',')){
            diff --;
            if (diff < 0){
                return false;
            }
            if (node != "#"){
                diff += 2; 
            }
        }
        return diff == 0;
    }
}; 
```
