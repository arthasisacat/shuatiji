## Description
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.

Example:

Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5

## Solution 1
2020/08/24 figured this out myself. haha. pretty easy.

Devide and conquer. 

Since the array is already sorted, think about the character of in order traversal for BST - we'll get a ordered array. Similar logic here, use middle one as root, then all numbers (nodes) on left side is smaller than root's value, all numbers (nodes) on right are bigger than root's value.

p.s. it's covering s == e (only 1 node in the tree) case as well.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        return build_BST(nums, 0, nums.size()-1);
    }
    TreeNode* build_BST(vector<int>& nums, int s, int e){
        if (s > e){
            return nullptr;
        }
        int mid = s + (e - s)/2;
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        root->left = build_BST(nums, s, mid-1);
        root->right = build_BST(nums, mid+1, e);
        return root;
    }
};
```

Another way to write it:

Same logic as solution 1, but learn the way to use constructor for `vector<int>`.
But I don't think this way is efficient!
```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedArrayToBST(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0) {
            return nullptr;
        }
        if (nums.size() == 1) {
            return new TreeNode(nums[0]);
        }
        int mid = nums.size() / 2;
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        vector<int> l(nums.begin(), nums.begin()+mid); // here it's index is from [0 ~ mid-1] 
        vector<int> r(nums.begin()+mid+1, nums.end()); // [mid+1 ~ end]
        root->left = sortedArrayToBST(l);
        root->right = sortedArrayToBST(r);
        return root;
    }
};
```
