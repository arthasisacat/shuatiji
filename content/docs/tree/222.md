# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4.5

**note**

## Description
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:

Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6

## Solution
need to utilize "complete" tree

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root){
            return 0;
        }
        TreeNode* l = root;
        TreeNode* r = root;
        int hl = 0, hr = 0;
        while (l){
            l = l->left;
            hl++;
        }
        while (r){
            r = r->right;
            hr++;
        }
        if (hl == hr){
            return (1<<hl) - 1;
        }
        return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
    }
};
```
