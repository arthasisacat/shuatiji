**note**

## Description
Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Example:

Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6

## Solution
need to utilize "complete" tree

Go to left most node and right most node, if height is the same, this tree is a complete tree. Then, how to compute the complete tree's node count? We don't need to count 1 by 1, 

```
                 lvl   count
         *       0      2^0
       *   *     1      2^1
      * * * *    2      2^2
```
If we have 3 levels in total (level 0, 1, 2), count is `2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = 2^3 - 1`

If we have n levels in total, count is `2^n - 1`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root){
            return 0;
        }
        TreeNode* l = root;
        TreeNode* r = root;
        int hl = 0, hr = 0;
        while (l){
            l = l->left;
            hl++;
        }
        while (r){
            r = r->right;
            hr++;
        }
        if (hl == hr){
            return (1<<hl) - 1;
        }
        return 1 + countNodes(root->left) + countNodes(root->right);
    }
};
```
