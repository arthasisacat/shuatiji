# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
4

**note**

## Description
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 

Example 1:



Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
Example 2:



Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
 
Note:

The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

## Solution
Obvious it's BFS.
But this time, we don't need to exclude empty children. We put them into queue anyway. Take them out, mark **first null one** (allowed). If after marking, we see nodes that are not null, then this is wrong and the tree is not complete!

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCompleteTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root){
            return true;
        }
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        bool seen_empty = false; 
        while (!q.empty()){
            TreeNode* cur = q.front(); q.pop();
            if (!cur){
                seen_empty = true;
            }
            else {
                if (seen_empty){
                    return false; // non empty node after empty node
                }
                q.push(cur->left);
                q.push(cur->right);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
