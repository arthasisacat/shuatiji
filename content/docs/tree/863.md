# 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree
[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/)

**difficulty(1-5)**
5

**note**

## Description
We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value K.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2

Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.



Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.
 

Note:

The given tree is non-empty.
Each node in the tree has unique values 0 <= node.val <= 500.
The target node is a node in the tree.
0 <= K <= 1000.

## Solution
1. dfs to find target. use recursion to mark all nodes in the path to distance to target. save distance to map `m`
2. dps again from node to all nodes. if node is in `m` use m[node], otherwise it's distance to target is it's father's distance to target (passed to it) +1 


```c++
class Solution {
    unordered_map<TreeNode*,int> m; 
    vector<int> res;
public:
    int find(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target){
        if (!root){
            return -1;
        }
        if (root == target){
            m[root] = 0;
            return 0;
        }
        int l = find(root->left, target);
        int r = find(root->right, target);
        if (l >= 0){
            m[root] = l+1;
            return l+1;
        }
        if (r >= 0){ // l and r will not >= 0 at the same time actually
            m[root] = r+1;
            return r+1;
        }
        // if not find under root subtree, m[root] will not be created
        return -1;
    }
    
    void helper(TreeNode* cur, int d, int K){
        if (!cur){
            return;
        }
        d = m.count(cur) ? m[cur] : d+1;
        if (d == K){
            res.push_back(cur->val);
        }
        helper(cur->left, d, K);
        helper(cur->right, d, K);        
    }
    vector<int> distanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int K) {
        find(root, target);
        helper(root, m[root], K);
        return res;
    }
};
