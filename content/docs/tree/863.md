# 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

**difficulty(1-5)**

**note**

## Description
We are given a binary tree (with root node root), a target node, and an integer value K.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance K from the target node.  The answer can be returned in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, K = 2

Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.

Note that the inputs "root" and "target" are actually TreeNodes.
The descriptions of the inputs above are just serializations of these objects.
 

Note:

The given tree is non-empty.
Each node in the tree has unique values 0 <= node.val <= 500.
The target node is a node in the tree.
0 <= K <= 1000.

## Solution
1. dfs to find target. use recursion to mark all nodes in the path to distance to target. save distance to map `m`
2. dfs again from node to all nodes. if node is in `m` use m[node], otherwise it's distance to target is it's father's distance to target (passed to it) +1 

Some special notes about following code, I don't think the code is very good to be understood:
1. `find()` is used to do first pass, to calculate distance from root to target.
   Thus, in `find()` you'll notice that once dfs find the target, the rest of nodes in the tree will not be visitd at all. This means in after `find()` is ran, only the path from root->target has meaningful (non-zero) distance value in `m`, the rest does not even get to be saved to value
   We can certain combine all the return value and return only at the end, that means a lot of node's m[node] will be -1 which is meaningless, plus **it's no use to visit nodes that are not on root->target path!**
2. when entering the `helper()` for first time, `m[root]` must exist no need to pass into helper function for d, passing any garbage data does not matter, it's just ugly!

```c++
class Solution {
    unordered_map<TreeNode*,int> m; 
    vector<int> res;
public:
    int find(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target){
        if (!root){
            return -1;
        }
        if (root == target){
            m[root] = 0;
            return 0;
        }
        int l = find(root->left, target);
        int r = find(root->right, target);
        if (l >= 0){
            m[root] = l+1;
            return l+1;
        }
        if (r >= 0){ // l and r will not >= 0 at the same time actually
            m[root] = r+1;
            return r+1;
        }
        // if not find under root subtree, m[root] will not be created
        return -1;
    }
    
    void helper(TreeNode* cur, int d, int K){
        if (!cur){
            return;
        }
        d = m.count(cur) ? m[cur] : d+1;
        if (d == K){
            res.push_back(cur->val);
        }
        helper(cur->left, d, K);
        helper(cur->right, d, K);        
    }
    vector<int> distanceK(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* target, int K) {
        find(root, target);
        /* 
        when entering the helper for first time, m[root] 
        must exist no need to pass into helper function for d, passing any
         garbage data is ok
         -1 can be any random number, it'll not be used.
        */
        helper(root, -1, K); 
        return res;
    }
};
