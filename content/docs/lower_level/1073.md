## Description

Given two numbers arr1 and arr2 in base -2, return the result of adding them together.

Each number is given in array format:  as an array of 0s and 1s, from most significant bit to least significant bit.  For example, arr = [1,1,0,1] represents the number (-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3.  A number arr in array format is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros: either arr == [0] or arr[0] == 1.

Return the result of adding arr1 and arr2 in the same format: as an array of 0s and 1s with no leading zeros.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1], arr2 = [1,0,1]
Output: [1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: arr1 represents 11, arr2 represents 5, the output represents 16.
 

Note:

1 <= arr1.length <= 1000
1 <= arr2.length <= 1000
arr1 and arr2 have no leading zeros
arr1[i] is 0 or 1
arr2[i] is 0 or 1

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> addNegabinary(vector<int>& arr1, vector<int>& arr2) {
        vector<int> res;
        int c = 0;
        int i = arr1.size()-1, j = arr2.size()-1;
        while(c != 0 || i >= 0 || j >= 0){
            int sum = c;
            if (i >= 0){
                sum += arr1[i--];
            }
            if (j >= 0){
                sum += arr2[j--];
            }
            if(sum >= 2){
                sum = sum - 2;
                c = -1;
            }
            else if (sum < 0){
                sum = 1;
                c = 1;
            }
            else{
                c = 0;
            }
            res.insert(res.begin(), sum);
        }
        while(res.size() >1 && *res.begin() == 0){
            res.erase(res.begin());
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
