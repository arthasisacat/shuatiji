# 868. Binary Gap

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**   


## Description
Given a positive integer N, find and return the longest distance between two consecutive 1's in the binary representation of N.

If there aren't two consecutive 1's, return 0. 

Example 1:

Input: 22
Output: 2
Explanation: 
22 in binary is 0b10110.
In the binary representation of 22, there are three ones, and two consecutive pairs of 1's.
The first consecutive pair of 1's have distance 2.
The second consecutive pair of 1's have distance 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 
5 in binary is 0b101.
Example 3:

Input: 6
Output: 1
Explanation: 
6 in binary is 0b110.
Example 4:

Input: 8
Output: 0
Explanation: 
8 in binary is 0b1000.
There aren't any consecutive pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 10^9

## Solution
题目没说清楚。其实不是consecutive，而是adjacent 1s

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int binaryGap(int N) {
        // problem has stated it's positive number. so no need to worry about anything :)
        int last_i = -1;
        int cur = 0;
        int res = 0;
        while (N) {
            if (N&1){
                if (last_i != -1) {
                    res = max(res, cur - last_i);
                }
                last_i = cur;
            }
            cur ++;
            N >>= 1;            
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
