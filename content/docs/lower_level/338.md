# 338. Counting Bits

**notes**   


## Description
Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.


## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int num) {
        vector<int> res(num+1, 0);
        for (int n = 1; n <= num; n++){
            // n&n-1 drop that lowest set bit, then add 1 back.
            res[n] = res[n&n-1]+1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
