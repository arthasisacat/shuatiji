## Description
Given a number s in their binary representation. Return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.

If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It's guaranteed that you can always reach to one for all testcases.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1101"
Output: 6
Explanation: "1101" corressponds to number 13 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 13 is odd, add 1 and obtain 14. 
Step 2) 14 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 7.
Step 3) 7 is odd, add 1 and obtain 8.
Step 4) 8 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 4.  
Step 5) 4 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 2. 
Step 6) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
Example 2:

Input: s = "10"
Output: 1
Explanation: "10" corressponds to number 2 in their decimal representation.
Step 1) 2 is even, divide by 2 and obtain 1.  
Example 3:

Input: s = "1"
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of characters '0' or '1'
s[0] == '1'


## Solution
```c++
/* 1001 -> 1010 -> 101 -> 110 -> 11 -> 100 -> 10 -> 1
s                  100           10            1
c                   1             1            1
real_s = (s+c)     101           11           10
cnt                 2             4            6    7

if c+s[i] == 1  2 jumps
if c+s[i] == 0  1 jump
if c+s[i] == 2  that means that bit is actually 0 because real_s = s + c , so 1 jump.
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int numSteps(string s) {
        int c = 0;
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = s.length()-1; i>0; i--){
            cnt++;
            if ((c + s[i] - '0') == 1){ // it has to be 1 and 0, cannot be carry 1 number 1 case!
                cnt++;
                c = 1;
            }
        }
        return cnt+c;
    }
};
```
