**notes**   


## Description

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

## Solution: bit operation
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int res = 0;
        while (x || y) {
            res += ((x&1) ^ (y&1)); // adding parenthesis to be extremely careful about operation precedence!
            x >>= 1;
            y >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
