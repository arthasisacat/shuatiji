negative base

## Description

Given a number N, return a string consisting of "0"s and "1"s that represents its value in base -2 (negative two).

The returned string must have no leading zeroes, unless the string is "0".

 

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: "110"
Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 = 2
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: "111"
Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 + (-2) ^ 1 + (-2) ^ 0 = 3
Example 3:

Input: 4
Output: "100"
Explantion: (-2) ^ 2 = 4
 

Note:

0 <= N <= 10^9

## Solution
From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_base)

### Calculation
The base −r expansion of a number can be found by repeated division by −r, recording the non-negative remainders, and concatenating those remainders, starting with the last. Note that if a / b = c, remainder d, then bc + d = a and therefore d = a - bc. To arrive at the correct conversion, the value for c must be chosen such that d is non-negative and minimal. This is exemplified in the fourth line of the following example wherein –5 ÷ –3 must be chosen to equal 2 remainder 1 instead of 1 remainder 2.

For example, to convert 146 in decimal to negaternary:

￼
Reading the remainders *backward* we obtain the negaternary representation of 14610: 21102–3.

Proof: (((2·(–3)+1)·(–3)+1)·(–3)+0)·(–3)+2 = 14610.

### Programming
Note that in most programming languages, the result (in integer arithmetic) of dividing a negative number by a negative number is rounded towards 0, usually leaving a negative remainder. In such a case we have a = (−r)c + d = (−r)c + d − r + r = (−r)(c + 1) + (d + r). Because |d| < r, (d + r) is the positive remainder. Therefore, to get the correct result in such case, computer implementations of the above algorithm should add 1 and r to the quotient and remainder respectively.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string baseNeg2(int N) {
        string res = "";
        while(N){
            int rem = N % (-2);
            N /= (-2);
            // cout<<"rem "<<rem<<" N "<<N<<endl;
            if (rem < 0){
                rem += 2;
                N++;
                // cout<<" -- rem "<<rem<<" N "<<N<<endl;
            }
            res = to_string(rem) + res;
        }
        return res == "" ? "0" : res;
    }
};
```
