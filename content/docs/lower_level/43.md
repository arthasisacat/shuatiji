## Description

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

Example 1:

Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
Example 2:

Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
Note:

The length of both num1 and num2 is < 110.
Both num1 and num2 contain only digits 0-9.
Both num1 and num2 do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

## Solution

notes: see this line `string res(n1+n2,'0'); // max length will not exceed n1+n2, remove extra 0 later`
why it's n1+n2 length? 
think about `99*9`, it's obvious that `99*9 < 100*10`, and 100*10 = 1000. thus 99*9 definitely has 3 digits for it's output.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string multiply(string num1, string num2) {
        int n1 = num1.length(), n2 = num2.length();
        if(n1 == 0 || n2 == 0){
            return "0";
        }
        string res(n1+n2,'0'); // max length will not exceed n1+n2, remove extra 0 later
        for(int i = n1-1; i >= 0; i--){
            int c = 0;
            for(int j = n2-1; j >= 0; j--){
                int sum = (res[i+j+1]-'0') + (num1[i]-'0')*(num2[j]-'0') + c;
                res[i+j+1] = (sum%10+'0');
                c = sum/10;
            }
            res[i] = (char)(c + '0');
        }
        while(res[0] == '0' && res.size() > 1){
            res.erase(0,1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
