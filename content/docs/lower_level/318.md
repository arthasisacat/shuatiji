learn to use one int to save more information (as a mask)

## Description
Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16 
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
Example 2:

Input: ["a","ab","abc","d","cd","bcd","abcd"]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The two words can be "ab", "cd".
Example 3:

Input: ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: 0 
Explanation: No such pair of words.


## Solution

We need a way to know what letters this word contains, in a fast and compact way.

The solution is to use a int mask, it has 32 bits - enough to save appearance of 26 letters in 
one word: for example, LSB can be 0 if no 'a' exists, be 1 if 'a' exists. 

Thus, mask_word1 represents all letters that appears in word1, mask_word2 represents all letters
that appears in word2. 

if `mask_word1 & mask_word2` is 0, then it means word1 and word2 don't share same letters. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();
        vector<int> mask(n,0); // save each word's mask 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for (auto c : words[i]){
                mask[i] |= 1 << (c-'a');
            }
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++){
                if ((mask[i] & mask[j]) == 0){
                    res = max(res, (int)words[i].length() * (int)words[j].length());
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
