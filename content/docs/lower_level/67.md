**notes**   


## Description
Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.

Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"


## Solution
Notes:
1. Trick I made is to always make `a(res)` to be longer than `b`, and use b to add to `a(res)`.
2. `i` is 'cnts' instead of real index, real index is calculated as `pa` and `pb`.
3. why I don't say `while(i < res.lenght() || carry`? Because res length will add by 1, example: `11+11 = 110` so using this `res.length()` is making things more complicated. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string addBinary(string a, string b) {
        string res = (a.length() > b.length()) ? a : b; // keep a(res) as the longer one!
        b = (a.length() > b.length()) ? b : a;
        int i = 0;
        int carry = 0;
        while (i < res.length()) {
            int pa = res.length() - 1 - i;
            int pb = b.length() - 1 - i;
            int sum = carry + (res[pa] == '1');
            if (pb >= 0){
                sum += (b[pb] == '1');
            }
            carry = sum/2;
            res[pa] = (sum%2) ? '1' : '0';
            i++;
        }
        if (carry){
            res = '1' + res;
        }        
        return res;        
    }
};
```
