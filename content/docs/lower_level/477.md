# 477. Total Hamming Distance
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-hamming-distance/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.

Example:
Input: 4, 14, 2

Output: 6

Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
showing the four bits relevant in this case). So the answer will be:
HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
Note:
Elements of the given array are in the range of 0 to 10^9
Length of the array will not exceed 10^4.


## Solution
```c++
/* n numbers in total. 
for each bit i from 0 ~ 31, (or 31~0, doesn't matter), if there are k numbers have that bit set, 
then there are (n-k) numbers have that bit cleared. difference is (n-k)*k
add them together for each bit position.
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int totalHammingDistance(vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = 0;
        int n = nums.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++){
            int mask = 1 << i;
            int cnt = 0; // count number of 1 (set bit) on position i for all numbers
            for (auto num : nums){
                cnt += (num & mask) ? 1 : 0;
            }
            res += cnt * (n-cnt);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
