## Description
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99


## Solution
```c++
/* For every bit/position, all numbers except for 1 shows up 3 times. 
additional one is the desired number. 
what if we can count appearance of each bit in the number? Init cnt 00(b).
first appearance 01(b); second apperance 10(b); third appearnce, instead of 
going to 11, we go back to 0, because 3 times is good and can be 'eliminated'.
If this bit/position have a forth time, it becomes 1 again and persists - that
is the returned number's bit.
to do this, image every number in nums[] has k bits. 
   0. 1 .. k-1 k
   _  _  _  _  _
one  
two

Use [two,one] combined together to record each bit's counts. two is MSB
and one is LSB. 
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int one = 0, two = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            one = (one^nums[i]) & ~two;
            two = (two^nums[i]) & ~one;
        }
        return one;
    }
};
```
