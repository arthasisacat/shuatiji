gray code

## Description
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1
Example 2:

Input: 0
Output: [0]
Explanation: We define the gray code sequence to begin with 0.
             A gray code sequence of n has size = 2n, which for n = 0 the size is 20 = 1.
             Therefore, for n = 0 the gray code sequence is [0].


## Solution

Proof:

I try to give a simple proof here. Let's denote i^(i>>1) as f(i). To proof f(i) is the ith gray code, we only need to prove the following statements:

f(0) = 0
(i) and f(i+1) only differs in one digit
f(i) is bijective, e.g. f(i) = f(j) if and only if i = j.
The first one is obvious.

For the second , f(i) ^ f(i+1) = i^(i>>1)^(i+1)^((i+1)>>1) = (i^(i+1)) ^ ((i^(i+1)) >> 1). Let's denote g(i) = i^(i+1), g(i) has the form of 0000111...111. So f(i) ^ f(i+1) = g(i) ^ g(i)>>1 = 00001000...000.

The third part can be proved alike.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < 1<<n; i++){
            res.push_back(i^(i>>1));
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
