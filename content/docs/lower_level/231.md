**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   


## Description
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: true 
Explanation: 20 = 1
Example 2:

Input: 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16
Example 3:

Input: 218
Output: false


## Solution

Use trick of `n & (n-1)`: `n&(n-1)` clears right most 1, so if n is power of 2,
then it must qualifies that after cleaning the right most 1 (which is the only 1
it has), it becomes 0.
Plus another continue that n has to meet is n > 0.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        return (n > 0) && ((n&(n-1)) == 0);
    }
};
```
