**notes**   
知识点：gray code

## Description

Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that :

p[0] = start
p[i] and p[i+1] differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
p[0] and p[2^n -1] must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, start = 3
Output: [3,2,0,1]
Explanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (11,10,00,01). 
All the adjacent element differ by one bit. Another valid permutation is [3,1,0,2]
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, start = 2
Output: [2,6,7,5,4,0,1,3]
Explanation: The binary representation of the permutation is (010,110,111,101,100,000,001,011).
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 16
0 <= start < 2 ^ n

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> circularPermutation(int n, int start) {
        /* Use gray code to generate this sequence. G(i) = i^(i>>1)
        then how to make it start from 'start'? 
        A good explanation is 
        1. start ^ 0 = start
        2. for two consecutive gray code, their hamming distance x^y = 1 
        (hamming distance is defined as the # of different bits between two binary number)
        thus hamming distance of (x^start)^(y^start) = (x^y)^(start^start) = 1
        (xor has commutativity and associativity)
        */
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < (1<<n); i++){
            res.push_back(start^i^(i>>1));
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
