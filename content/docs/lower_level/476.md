# 476. Number Complement
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   
signed int's shift is not defined in c++!

## Description
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to *flip the bits of its binary representation.*

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

## Solution
We cannot simply flip all bits of the signed integer because flipping sign will 
result in changing numbers to negative (and also new negative number is not 
negatively equal to original one). 

Thus we need to *only care about bit that are representing numbers, and ignore
 signed bits*
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        unsigned int mask = ~0; // 11111111
        while (mask & num) {
            mask <<= 1;
        } // mask = 11111000 
        return ~mask & ~num;
    }
};
```
