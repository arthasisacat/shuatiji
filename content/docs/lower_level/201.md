**notes**   


## Description
Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Example 1:

Input: [5,7]
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: [0,1]
Output: 0


## Solution
```c++
/* The & on range from m to n will clear all lower bits that are uncommon between m and n
so let m and n shift right by 1 position every time until they are the same. these are the common bits left. 
then shift it back to it's original position.
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        int i = 0;
        while (m != n){
            m >>= 1;
            n >>= 1;
            i++;
        }
        return m << i;
    }
};
```
