## Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
Note:

There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.
Follow up: Could you improve it to O(n log n) time complexity?

## Solution 1: DP, O(n^2)
DP[i] definition: 
longest subsequence length that is chosen from 0 ~i and must end with nums[i]

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> dp(n,0);
        int res = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            for (int i = j-1; i >= 0; i--){
                if(nums[i] < nums[j]){
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], 1+dp[i]);
                }
            }
            res = max(res, dp[j]);
        }
        return res+1;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2:  O(nlogn)
Runtime: To get an O(n log n ) runtime, I'm going to create a second list S. (Stick with me for now -- I'll get rid of it in a minute to get O(1) space.) I'll do a single pass through nums, and as I look at each element:
The length of S will be equal to the length of the longest subsequence I've found to that point.
The last element of S will be the last element of that subsequence. (However, the earlier elements may no longer be part of that sequence -- S is not actually the subsequence itself.)
At the end, the length of S will be our solution.
S will be sorted at all times. Each new element is inserted into S, replacing the smallest element in S that is not smaller than it (which we can find with a binary search). If that element is larger than the last element of S, then we extend S by one -- maintaining both properties.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i ++) {
            auto it = lower_bound(res.begin(), res.end(), nums[i]);
            if (it == res.end()) {
                res.push_back(nums[i]);
            }
            else {
                *it = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return res.size();
    }
};
```
