## Description
Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?

Example:

Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3

## Solution

dp[k]
: number of different unique ways to form BST using **k nodes**, k range [0,n].

return
: dp[n]

equation
: dp[k] = sum of (dp[i] * dp[k-i-1]) for i = [0, k-1]
```
i     0 1 2 3 4     (k = 5)
          i
    [ x x x x x ]
i is the chosen root node, thus i has 5 positions to choose from. After i is fixed, the BST cnts if i is fixed is `dp[number of nodes on i's left side]*dp[number of nodes on i's right side]`, which is `dp[i]*dp[k-i-1]`. (remember that i is not included on either side)
```

**note** 

dp[0] must be set to 1 for calculation, although if n == 0, we should return 0.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numTrees(int n) {
        if (n <= 2){
            return n;
        }
        vector<int> dp(n+1,0);
        dp[0] = 1; // this is not true if n = 0, but must be like this for future calculation!
        dp[1] = 1;
        for(int k = 2; k <= n; k++){
            for(int i = 0; i < k; i++){
                dp[k] += dp[i]*dp[k-i-1];
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
