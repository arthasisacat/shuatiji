## Description
Alex and Lee continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.  Initially, M = 1.

On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alex can get.

 

Example 1:

Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:  If Alex takes one pile at the beginning, Lee takes two piles, then Alex takes 2 piles again. Alex can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alex takes two piles at the beginning, then Lee can take all three piles left. In this case, Alex get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. 
 

Constraints:

1 <= piles.length <= 100
1 <= piles[i] <= 10 ^ 4

## Solution
`memo[i][m]`:
maximum number of stones cur player can get if piles are left `[i~n-1]` (originall `[0~n-1]`), with M = m.

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    vector<int> sums; // sums[i] = sum of piles [i~n-1]
    vector<vector<int>> memo;
public:
    int stoneGameII(vector<int>& piles) {
        int n = piles.size();
        sums.resize(n,0);
        memo.resize(n, vector<int>(n,0));
        sums[n-1] = piles[n-1];
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--){
            sums[i] = sums[i+1] + piles[i];
        }        
        return helper(n, 0, 1);
    }
    
    int helper(int n, int i, int m){
        if (i >= n){
            return 0;
        }
        if (2*m >= (n-i)){ // current play takes all 
            return sums[i];
        }
        if (memo[i][m] != 0) {
            return memo[i][m];
        }
        int cur = INT_MAX;
        for (int x = 1; x <= 2*m; x++){
            cur = min(cur, helper(n, i+x, max(m, x))); // make next player takes min.
        }
        memo[i][m] = sums[i] - cur;
        return memo[i][m];
    }
};
```
