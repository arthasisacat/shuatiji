**notes**   


## Description

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3 
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
Example 2:

Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

## Solution

dp[i]: min coin used for amount = i. i is from 0~amount

return: dp[amount]

dp[i] = min(dp[i-c] + 1), c picked from coins.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        if (amount < 0){
            return -1;
        }
        unordered_set<int> c(coins.begin(), coins.end());
        sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());
        vector<int> dp(amount+1, INT_MAX); // dp[i]: min coin count to sum up to i
        dp[0] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= amount; i++){
            for(int k = 0; k < coins.size() && (coins[k] <= i); k++){
                if(dp[i-coins[k]] < INT_MAX){
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-coins[k]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[amount] == INT_MAX ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
};
```
