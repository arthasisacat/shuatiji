# 790. Domino and Tromino Tiling
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
6

**notes**   

## Description
We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.

XX  <- domino

XX  <- "L" tromino
X
Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)

Example:
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:
XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY
Note:

N  will be in range [1, 1000].

## Solution
...too hard.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numTilings(int N) {
        vector<int> dp(1001,0);
        int mod = 1e9 + 7;
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        dp[3] = 5;
        if (N<=3){
            return dp[N];
        }
        for(int i = 4; i <= N; i++){
            dp[i] = 2*dp[i-1]%mod + dp[i-3];
            dp[i] %= mod;
        }
        return dp[N];
    }
};
