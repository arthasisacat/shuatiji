next question: [63](/docs/63)

## Description
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

 

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
 

Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 100
It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 10 ^ 9.

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n,0));
        dp[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if (i > 0){
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j];
                }
                if (j > 0){
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
};
```
