**notes**   


## Description
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to make word1 and word2 the same, where in each step you can delete one character in either string.

Example 1:
Input: "sea", "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
Note:
The length of given words won't exceed 500.
Characters in given words can only be lower-case letters.

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int n1 = word1.size(), n2 = word2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n1+1, vector<int>(n2+1));
        for (int i = 0; i <= n1; i++){ // word1 keeps[0~i], word2 is empty, how many operations we need to make them equal
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j <= n2; j++){ // word2 keeps [0~j], word1 is empty, how many operations we need to make them equal 
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i <= n1; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= n2; j++){
                if (word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1];
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = min({dp[i-1][j-1]+2, // delete i& j positions
                                   dp[i-1][j] +1, // delete i position
                                   dp[i][j-1] + 1 // delete jj position
                                    });
                }
                // cout<<i<<" "<<j<<" "<<dp[i][j]<<endl;
            }
        }
        return dp[n1][n2];
    }
};
```
