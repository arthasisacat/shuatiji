# 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)

Return the maximum profit you can make.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1
Selling at prices[3] = 8
Buying at prices[4] = 4
Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
Note:

0 < prices.length <= 50000.
0 < prices[i] < 50000.
0 <= fee < 50000.

## Solution
sell[i]: 第i天当天或之前卖/已经卖掉股票的最大收益

buy[i]: 第i天当太难或之前买/已经买了股票的最大收益

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<int> buy(n, 0);
        vector<int> sell(n,0);
        buy[0] = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            sell[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1]+prices[i]-fee);
            buy[i] = max(buy[i-1], sell[i-1]-prices[i]);
        }
        return sell[n-1];
    }
};
```
