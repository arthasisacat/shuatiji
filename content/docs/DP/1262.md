## Description
Given an array nums of integers, we need to find the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
Output: 18
Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSumDivThree(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> dp = {0,0,0};
        for (auto num : nums){
            vector<int> buf = dp;
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++){
                int tmp = (dp[i]+num)%3;
                buf[tmp] = max(buf[tmp], dp[i]+num);
            }
            dp = buf;
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```
