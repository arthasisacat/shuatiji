# 837. New 21 Game

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
6? 7?

**notes**   


## Description

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?

Example 1:

Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
Example 2:

Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.
Example 3:

Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
Output: 0.73278
Note:

0 <= K <= N <= 10000
1 <= W <= 10000

## Solution

Numbers we can reach at the end is `[K, K-1+W]`

If N > (K-1+W) then possiblity is 1. Always going to mean <= N criteria. 

`p[i]` is the possibility to reach i, i starts from 0, to N (well it can grow above N for sure but we don't care).

`p[ <=N ] = p[W] + p[W+1] +... + p[N]` this is assuming N >= W. 

What is `p[i]`? 

`p[i] = p[i-1]*p[draw 1] + p[i-2]*p[draw 2] + ... + p[i-W]*p[draw W]`

Note that `p[draw 1]` ~ `p[draw W]` all equals to `1/W`.

=> `p[i] = p[i-1]*1/W + p[i-2]*1/W + ... + p[i-W]*1/W`

=> `p[i] = (p[i-1] + p[i-2] + ... + p[i-W])/W`

sum of `p[i-1]` to `p[i-W]` can be solved by sliding window.


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {
        // final point is within [K, K-1+W]
        if (K == 0 || K-1+W < N){
            return 1.0f;
        }
        vector<double> p(N+1,0.0f); // p[i]: probability of reach point i
        p[0] = 1.0f;
        double psum = 1.0, res = 0.0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= N; i++){
            p[i] = psum/W;
            if (i < K){
                psum += p[i];
            }
            if(i >= W){
                psum -= p[i-W];
            }

            if(i >= K){ // i is [K,N] (i<=N always true in for loop)
                res += p[i];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
