# 1035. Uncrossed Lines
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/uncrossed-lines/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   


## Description
We write the integers of A and B (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

Now, we may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers A[i] and B[j] such that:

A[i] == B[j];
The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.
Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

 

Example 1:


Input: A = [1,4,2], B = [1,2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.
Example 2:

Input: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: A = [1,3,7,1,7,5], B = [1,9,2,5,1]
Output: 2
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 500
1 <= B.length <= 500
1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2000

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxUncrossedLines(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(A.size(), vector<int>(B.size(),0));
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < B.size(); j++){
                if (i == 0 && j == 0){
                    dp[i][j] = (A[0] == B[0]) ? 1 : 0;
                }
                else if (i == 0){
                    dp[i][j] = A[i]== B[j] ? 1 : dp[i][j-1];
                }
                else if (j == 0){
                    dp[i][j] = A[i]== B[j] ? 1 : dp[i-1][j];
                }
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = max({dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1] + (A[i]==B[j] ? 1 : 0)});
                }
                // cout<<i<<" "<<j<<" "<<dp[i][j]<<endl;
            }
        }
        return dp[A.size()-1][B.size()-1];
    }
};
```
