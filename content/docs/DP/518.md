# 518. Coin Change 2
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-2/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

Example 1:

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
Example 2:

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
Example 3:

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
 

Note:

You can assume that

0 <= amount <= 5000
1 <= coin <= 5000
the number of coins is less than 500
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

## Solution
dp[i] definition: combination cnts when amount is i.

```c++
/*
dp[i] : i: [0, amount] 
amount == i 时的可能组合个数.
注意这里必须把 coin 放在外循环! 
如果把 coin 放在内循环会重复计算. 
例子: coins = [1,2] amount = 3
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) {
        vector<int> dp(amount+1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for(int coin_idx = 0; coin_idx < coins.size(); coin_idx++){
            for (int a = 1; a <= amount; a++){
                if (coins[coin_idx] > a){
                    continue;
                }
                dp[a] += dp[a-coins[coin_idx]];
            }
        }
        return dp[amount];
    }
};
```
