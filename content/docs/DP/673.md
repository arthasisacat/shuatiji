## Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
Note: Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.

## Solution
```c++
/* DP idea:
To record the maximum length of increasing subsequence and the corresponding counts 
of subsequences which has
the maximum length, that ends with each index j.
len[j]: max subsequence len that must ends with j
cnt[j]: cnt of subsequences whose length is len[j] (the max len)
res is the sum of cnt[j] whose corresponding len[j] is longest_len. 
(longest_len gets updated every time len[j] is determined)

        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> len(n, 0);
        vector<int> cnt(n, 0);
        int longest_len = 0;
        int res = 0;
        for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
            len[j] = 1;
            cnt[j] = 1;
            for(int i = 0; i < j; i++){
                if (nums[j] > nums[i]){
                    if (len[j] == (len[i]+1)){
                        cnt[j] += cnt[i];
                    }
                    else if (len[j] < (len[i]+1)){
                        len[j] = len[i]+1;
                        cnt[j] = cnt[i];
                    }
                }
            }
            if (longest_len < len[j]){
                longest_len = len[j];
                res = cnt[j];
            }
            else if (longest_len == len[j]){
                res += cnt[j];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
