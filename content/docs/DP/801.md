# 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-swaps-to-make-sequences-increasing/)

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**   

## Description
We have two integer sequences A and B of the same non-zero length.

We are allowed to swap elements A[i] and B[i].  Note that both elements are in the same index position in their respective sequences.

At the end of some number of swaps, A and B are both strictly increasing.  (A sequence is strictly increasing if and only if A[0] < A[1] < A[2] < ... < A[A.length - 1].)

Given A and B, return the minimum number of swaps to make both sequences strictly increasing.  It is guaranteed that the given input always makes it possible.

Example:
Input: A = [1,3,5,4], B = [1,2,3,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Swap A[3] and B[3].  Then the sequences are:
A = [1, 3, 5, 7] and B = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
Note:

A, B are arrays with the same length, and that length will be in the range [1, 1000].
A[i], B[i] are integer values in the range [0, 2000].

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwap(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        int n = A.size();
        // swap[i] : min swaps that makes 0~i ascending for A, B, must swap i
        // not_swap[i] : min swaps that makes 0~i ascending for A, B; must NOT swap i
        vector<int> swap(n, INT_MAX), not_swap(n, INT_MAX);
        swap[0] = 1;
        not_swap[0] = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            // not swap i
            if(A[i] > A[i-1] && B[i] > B[i-1]){
                not_swap[i] = not_swap[i-1];
            }
            if (A[i] > B[i-1] && B[i] > A[i-1]){
                not_swap[i] = min(not_swap[i], swap[i-1]);
            }
                
            // swap i
            if (A[i] > B[i-1] && B[i] > A[i-1]){
                swap[i] = not_swap[i-1] + 1;
            }
            if(A[i] > A[i-1] && B[i] > B[i-1]){
                swap[i] = min(swap[i], swap[i-1] + 1);
            }
        }
        return min(swap[n-1], not_swap[n-1]);        
    }
};
```
