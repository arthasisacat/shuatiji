# 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
You have d dice, and each die has f faces numbered 1, 2, ..., f.

Return the number of possible ways (out of fd total ways) modulo 10^9 + 7 to roll the dice so the sum of the face up numbers equals target.

 

Example 1:

Input: d = 1, f = 6, target = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 
You throw one die with 6 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 3.
Example 2:

Input: d = 2, f = 6, target = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: 
You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.  There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7:
1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.
Example 3:

Input: d = 2, f = 5, target = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: 
You throw two dice, each with 5 faces.  There is only one way to get a sum of 10: 5+5.
Example 4:

Input: d = 1, f = 2, target = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 
You throw one die with 2 faces.  There is no way to get a sum of 3.
Example 5:

Input: d = 30, f = 30, target = 500
Output: 222616187
Explanation: 
The answer must be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
 

Constraints:

1 <= d, f <= 30
1 <= target <= 1000

## Solution
DP. dp[target][d] is with d dices how many possibilities to reach to target. 
But in fact, when calculating dp[target][d], we only need dp[target][d-1], no need for dp[target][d-2] and earlier. So to save space, only 1 dimention array is needed.

 */
class Solution {
public:
    int numRollsToTarget(int d, int f, int target) {
        vector<int> dp(target+1,0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= d; i++){
            vector<int> buf(target+1,0);
            for (int j = 1; j <= f; j++){
                for (int t = j; t <= target; t++){
                    buf[t] = (buf[t] + dp[t-j])%1000000007;
                }
            }
            swap(buf, dp);
        }
        return dp[target];
    }
};
```
