# 873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**   


## Description
A sequence X_1, X_2, ..., X_n is fibonacci-like if:

n >= 3
X_i + X_{i+1} = X_{i+2} for all i + 2 <= n
Given a strictly increasing array A of positive integers forming a sequence, find the length of the longest fibonacci-like subsequence of A.  If one does not exist, return 0.

(Recall that a subsequence is derived from another sequence A by deleting any number of elements (including none) from A, without changing the order of the remaining elements.  For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].)

 
```
Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].
Example 2:

Input: [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like:
[1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
 ```

Note:

3 <= A.length <= 1000
1 <= A[0] < A[1] < ... < A[A.length - 1] <= 10^9
(The time limit has been reduced by 50% for submissions in Java, C, and C++.)


## Solution:DP
dp[a][b]: a < b (A is strictly increasing array)
dp[a][b] = max(dp[b-a][a],2) + 1
here a, b is all values.
in real code we use i,j (index) so a, b is A[i], A[j]

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lenLongestFibSubseq(vector<int>& A) {
        int n = A.size();
        unordered_map<int,int> m; // num - idx
        for (int i = 0;i < n; i++){
            m[A[i]] = i;
        }
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n,0));
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++){
                if (m.count(A[j]-A[i])){
                    dp[i][j] = max(2, dp[m[A[j]-A[i]]][i]+1);
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = 2;
                }
                res = max(res, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
        return res<=2 ? 0 : res;
    }
};
```
