## Description
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
Example 2:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
Example 3:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= text1.length <= 1000
1 <= text2.length <= 1000
The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

## Solution 1: my version
`dp[i][j]`: longest common subsequence betwen text1[0~i] and text2[0~j]
return: `dp[n1-1][n2-1]`

Intuition:
```
dp[i][j] = max({dp[i-1][j],
                dp[i][j-1],
                dp[i-1[j-1] + text1[i]==text2[j] ? 1 : 0]})

```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        int n1 = text1.size(), n2 = text2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n1, vector<int>(n2,0));
        for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++){
                int tmp = 0;
                if (i < 1 || j < 1){
                    dp[i][j] = (text1[i] == text2[j]) ? 1 : 0;
                    if (i >= 1){
                        dp[i][j]= max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j]);
                    }
                    if (j >= 1){
                        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                    }
                }
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = max({dp[i-1][j],
                                    dp[i][j-1],
                                    dp[i-1][j-1] + (text1[i]==text2[j] ? 1 : 0)});   
                }
                // cout<<i<<" "<<j<<" "<<dp[i][j]<<endl;
            }
        }
        return dp[n1-1][n2-1];
    }
};
```
## Solution 2 : shorter
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        int n1 = text1.size(), n2 = text2.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n1+1, vector<int>(n2+1,0));
        for (int i = 1; i <= n1; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= n2; j++){
                if (text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                }
                else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n1][n2];
    }
};
```
