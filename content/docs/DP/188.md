## Description

Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k transactions.

Note:
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.

## Solution

```
dp[i][j]: max profit gained till j days, using up to i transactions (day j can do nothing)

dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], 
               max(prices[j]-prices[p]+ dp[i-1][p]))
                    where p is [0,j-1]
```

use `local_max` to keep track of the maximum of `dp[i-1][p]-prices[p]`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        
        // special case, k is big enough that is equivalent
        // to unlimited number of transactions
        if (k >= 2*n){
            int res = 0;
            for(int i = 1; i < n; i++){
                if(prices[i] > prices[i-1]){
                    res += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
                }
            }
            return res;
        }
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k+1, vector<int>(n,0));
        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++){
            int local_max = dp[i-1][0] - prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++){
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], prices[j] + local_max);
                local_max = max(local_max, dp[i-1][j] - prices[j]);
            }            
        }
        return dp[k][n-1];
        
    }
};
```
