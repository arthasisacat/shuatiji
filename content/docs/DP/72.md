**notes**   


## Description
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character
Example 1:

Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')

## Solution

I am not 100% sure on the insert and delete, I think they are actually the same effect...

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int m = word1.size(), n = word2.size();
        // dp[i][j]: mininum number of operations to make first i characters in word1 match
        // first j characters in word2
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+1, vector<int>(n+1,0));
        for(int i = 0; i <= m; i++){
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        for(int j = 0; j <= n; j++){
            dp[0][j] = j;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i <= m; i++){
            for(int j = 1; j <= n; j++){
                if(word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1];
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = min({dp[i-1][j-1], // replace one character to match the other one
                                   dp[i-1][j], // delete current one from word1
                                   dp[i][j-1]}) // delete current one from word2
                                +1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
```
