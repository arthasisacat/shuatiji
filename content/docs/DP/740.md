# 740. Delete and Earn
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   


## Description
Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: 
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
 

Note:

The length of nums is at most 20000.
Each element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].
 

## Solution
Other people's solution. I find it's hard to understand why they want to count from 10000 down to 0, the reason is actually that they don't need to special handle dp[1], dp[2]. 
I rewrote the code to a easier understandable version down below. 

VERSION I 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        // dp[i] definition: max cost after deleting [i~10000]
        vector<int> dp(100003,0);
        unordered_map<int,int> m; 
        for (auto num : nums){
            m[num] += num;
        }
        for (int i = 10000; i >= 0; i--){
            dp[i] = max(m[i]+dp[i+2], dp[i+1]);
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
};
```

VERSION II
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_map<int,int> m;
        int largest = 0;
        for (auto num : nums){
            m[num] += num;
            largest = max(largest, num);
        }
        vector<int> dp(largest+1,0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= largest; i++){
            if (i <= 2){
                dp[i] = (i == 1) ? m[1] : max(m[1],m[2]);
            }
            else{
                dp[i] = max(m[i]+dp[i-2], dp[i-1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[largest];
    }
};
```
