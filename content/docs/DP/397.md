# 397. Integer Replacement

[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-replacement/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   


## Description

Given a positive integer n and you can do operations as follow:

If n is even, replace n with n/2.
If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?

Example 1:

Input:
8

Output:
3

Explanation:
8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
Example 2:

Input:
7

Output:
4

Explanation:
7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
or
7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

## Solution

I really don't like the brain teaser like solution such as [this one](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-replacement/discuss/87920/A-couple-of-Java-solutions-with-explanations) it's meaningless and I cannot learn anything from it. 

Instead this problem can be solved by "DP" [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-replacement/discuss/88016/C%2B%2B-0ms-11-lines-%22DP%22-solution)

### first try

This is the basic idea but it'll fail when n = INT_MAX when we try to call `integerReplacement(INT_MAX+1)`.

see second try about how to avoid overflow.

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    unordered_map<int,int> dp;
public:
    int integerReplacement(int n) {
        if (n == 1){
            return 0;
        }
        if(dp.count(n)){
            return dp[n];
        }
        int res = 0;
        if (n % 2 == 0){
            res = integerReplacement(n/2);
        }
        else{
            res = min(integerReplacement(n+1), integerReplacement(n-1));
        }
        dp[n] = res+1;
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```

### second try

To avoid overflow, let's take `1101` as example, 
```    
1101 +1 -> 1110 /2 -> 111
     -1 -> 1100 /2 -> 110

1101 becomes 111 and 110 after two steps, how? by 1101/2 and 1101/2+1.
```

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    unordered_map<int,int> dp;
public:
    int integerReplacement(int n) {
        if (n == 1){
            return 0;
        }
        if(dp.count(n)){
            return dp[n];
        }
        int res = 0;
        if (n % 2 == 0){
            dp[n] = 1 + integerReplacement(n/2);
        }
        else{
            dp[n] = 2 + min(integerReplacement(n/2+1), integerReplacement(n/2));
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
```
