# 448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array

**notes**   
challenge: O(n) time, no extra space

做法很巧妙!

## Description
Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
```
Example:
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```
## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findDisappearedNumbers(vector<int>& nums) {
        // mark all appeared number '-' (negative sign) in their position
        // if they were sorted. if multiple number shows up, only mark it once
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int pos = abs(nums[i]) - 1; // num[i]'s true position in nums if it's sorted
            if (nums[pos] > 0) {
                nums[pos] = -nums[pos];
            }
        }
        // as a result, all positive *positions* are number that are
        // not been hit. (and don't care about their nums[i])
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                res.push_back(i+1);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
