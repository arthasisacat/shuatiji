# 370. Range Addition
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition/)

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes** 
非常神奇！！！

## Description
Assume you have an array of length n initialized with all 0's and are given k update operations.

Each operation is represented as a triplet: [startIndex, endIndex, inc] which increments each element of subarray A[startIndex ... endIndex] (startIndex and endIndex inclusive) with inc.

Return the modified array after all k operations were executed.

Example:

Input: length = 5, updates = [[1,3,2],[2,4,3],[0,2,-2]]
Output: [-2,0,3,5,3]
Explanation:

Initial state:
[0,0,0,0,0]

After applying operation [1,3,2]:
[0,2,2,2,0]

After applying operation [2,4,3]:
[0,2,5,5,3]

After applying operation [0,2,-2]:
[-2,0,3,5,3]

## Solution
for every update: {start, end, val}
mark A[start] += val, A[end+1] -= val
so that all elements after start (including start) will +val, except for ones after (including) end.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getModifiedArray(int length, vector<vector<int>>& updates) {
        vector<int> A(length, 0);
        for (auto k : updates){
            A[k[0]] += k[2];
            if (k[1]+1 < length)
            {
                A[k[1]+1] -= k[2];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < length; i++){
            A[i] += A[i-1];
        }
        return A;
    }
};
