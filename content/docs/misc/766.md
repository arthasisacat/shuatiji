# 766. Toeplitz Matrix
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/toeplitz-matrix/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   


## Description

A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element.
Now given an M x N matrix, return True if and only if the matrix is Toeplitz.
 ```
Example 1:
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]
Output: True
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
Example 2:
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2],
  [2,2]
]
Output: False
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
```
Note:
matrix will be a 2D array of integers.
matrix will have a number of rows and columns in range [1, 20].
matrix[i][j] will be integers in range [0, 99].

Follow up:
What if the matrix is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you can only load at most one row of the matrix into the memory at once?
What if the matrix is so large that you can only load up a partial row into the memory at once?

## Solution
`O(m*n)` 
写法上会有不同 有复杂有简单. 
这里贴一个简单的... 第0行,第0列不用去管它, 从[1,1]开始看,要符合条件,必须
`matrix[i][j] == matrix[i-1][j-1]`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isToeplitzMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        for (int i = 1; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < matrix[0].size(); j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] != matrix[i-1][j-1]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
