# 492. Construct the Rectangle

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes** 


## Description
For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
Example:
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
Note:
The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer
The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.


## Solution
从根号area 开始试
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> constructRectangle(int area) {
        int middle = sqrt(area);
        int x = middle + 1;
        while (x >= 1) {
            if (area%x == 0){
                int y = area/x;
                if (y >= x) {
                    return {y,x};
                }
                else {
                    return {x,y};
                }
            }
            x--;
        }
        return {-1,-1};
    }
};
```
