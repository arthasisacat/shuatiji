# 1184. Distance Between Bus Stops
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/distance-between-bus-stops/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes** 


## Description
A bus has n stops numbered from 0 to n - 1 that form a circle. We know the distance between all pairs of neighboring stops where distance[i] is the distance between the stops number i and (i + 1) % n.

The bus goes along both directions i.e. clockwise and counterclockwise.

Return the shortest distance between the given start and destination stops.

 

Example 1:



Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 1 is 1 or 9, minimum is 1.
 

Example 2:



Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 2 is 3 or 7, minimum is 3.
 

Example 3:



Input: distance = [1,2,3,4], start = 0, destination = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Distance between 0 and 3 is 6 or 4, minimum is 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^4
distance.length == n
0 <= start, destination < n
0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int distanceBetweenBusStops(vector<int>& distance, int start, int destination) {
        int cur = 0;
        int n = distance.size();
        for (int i = start; i != destination; ) {
            cur += distance[i];
            i = (i+1)%n;
        }
        int res = cur;
        cur = 0;
        for (int i = start; i != destination;) {
            cur += distance[(i+n-1)%n];
            i = (i+n-1)%n;
        }
        res = min(res, cur);
        return res;
    }
};
```
