Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?


## Description
On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.

You can move according to the next rules:

In one second always you can either move vertically, horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).
You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
 

Example 1:


Input: points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]
Output: 7
Explanation: One optimal path is [1,1] -> [2,2] -> [3,3] -> [3,4] -> [2,3] -> [1,2] -> [0,1] -> [-1,0]   
Time from [1,1] to [3,4] = 3 seconds 
Time from [3,4] to [-1,0] = 4 seconds
Total time = 7 seconds
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

points.length == n
1 <= n <= 100
points[i].length == 2
-1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000

## Solution
主要是算两点间最短的走路距离。就是三角形的直角边的长边。

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        /*
        min distance from A(x1, y1)  to B(x2, y2) is
        max(|x1-x2|, |y1-y2|)
        */
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++) {
            int cur_min = max(abs(points[i][0] - points[i-1][0]), 
                              abs(points[i][1] - points[i-1][1]));
            res += cur_min;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
