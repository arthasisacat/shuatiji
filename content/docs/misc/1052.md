# 1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/grumpy-bookstore-owner/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3

**notes** 
prefix sum, sliding window.

## Description
Today, the bookstore owner has a store open for customers.length minutes.  Every minute, some number of customers (customers[i]) enter the store, and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy.  If the bookstore owner is grumpy on the i-th minute, grumpy[i] = 1, otherwise grumpy[i] = 0.  When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for X minutes straight, but can only use it once.

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.

 

Example 1:

Input: customers = [1,0,1,2,1,1,7,5], grumpy = [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1], X = 3
Output: 16
Explanation: The bookstore owner keeps themselves not grumpy for the last 3 minutes. 
The maximum number of customers that can be satisfied = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 16.
 

Note:

1 <= X <= customers.length == grumpy.length <= 20000
0 <= customers[i] <= 1000
0 <= grumpy[i] <= 1


## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSatisfied(vector<int>& customers, vector<int>& grumpy, int X) {
        int res = 0;
        vector<int> ps(customers.size()+1,0);
        // 1. only counting none-grumpy time customers
        for (int i = 0; i < customers.size(); i++){
            if (grumpy[i] == 0){
                res += customers[i];
                ps[i+1] = ps[i];
            }
            else{
                ps[i+1] = ps[i]+customers[i];
            }
        }
        // 2. 
        int max_sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; (i+X-1) < customers.size(); i++){
            // [i, i+X-1]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, ps[i+X]-ps[i]);
        }
        return res + max_sum;
    }
};
