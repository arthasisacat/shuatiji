# 1005. Maximize Sum Of Array After K Negations
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-sum-of-array-after-k-negations/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes** 


## Description
Given an array A of integers, we must modify the array in the following way: we choose an i and replace A[i] with -A[i], and we repeat this process K times in total.  (We may choose the same index i multiple times.)

Return the largest possible sum of the array after modifying it in this way.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [4,2,3], K = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose indices (1,) and A becomes [4,-2,3].
Example 2:

Input: A = [3,-1,0,2], K = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 2, 2) and A becomes [3,1,0,2].
Example 3:

Input: A = [2,-3,-1,5,-4], K = 2
Output: 13
Explanation: Choose indices (1, 4) and A becomes [2,3,-1,5,4].
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000
1 <= K <= 10000
-100 <= A[i] <= 100


## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int largestSumAfterKNegations(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        sort(begin(A),end(A));
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size() && K > 0; i++){
            // flip sign for negative numbers as many as possible
            if (A[i] < 0) {
                A[i] = -A[i];
                K--;
            }
            // if after flipping all negative numbers there is still K left, we only need
            // to flip *1* positive (including those who turns from negative) because
            // if K = 3, first 2 flips can be used at same number so there is no effect. 
            // thus. if K%2 == 0, nothing needs to be done. great. 
            // if K%2 == 1, choose **currently** smallest number (since they are all positive now)
            // and flip
            else if (K%2) {
                sort(begin(A), end(A)); //!!! negative numbers now are all positive numbers, need to sort again.
                A[0] = -A[0]; 
                break;
            }
        }
        return accumulate(begin(A), end(A), 0);
    }
};
