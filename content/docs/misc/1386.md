Interesting problem.


## Description

![pic](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/14/cinema_seats_1.png)

A cinema has n rows of seats, numbered from 1 to n and there are ten seats in each row, labelled from 1 to 10 as shown in the figure above.

Given the array reservedSeats containing the numbers of seats already reserved, for example, reservedSeats[i] = [3,8] means the seat located in row 3 and labelled with 8 is already reserved.

Return the maximum number of four-person groups you can assign on the cinema seats. A four-person group occupies four adjacent seats in one single row. Seats across an aisle (such as [3,3] and [3,4]) are not considered to be adjacent, but there is an exceptional case on which an aisle split a four-person group, in that case, the aisle split a four-person group in the middle, which means to have two people on each side.

 

Example 1:



Input: n = 3, reservedSeats = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,8],[2,6],[3,1],[3,10]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The figure above shows the optimal allocation for four groups, where seats mark with blue are already reserved and contiguous seats mark with orange are for one group.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2, reservedSeats = [[2,1],[1,8],[2,6]]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: n = 4, reservedSeats = [[4,3],[1,4],[4,6],[1,7]]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^9
1 <= reservedSeats.length <= min(10*n, 10^4)
reservedSeats[i].length == 2
1 <= reservedSeats[i][0] <= n
1 <= reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10
All reservedSeats[i] are distinct.

## Solution: bitmask

The key is to think out this can be solved using bitmask.

Also, in ideal situation where no reserved seats, max 2 4-person group per row. Now we know the max res. Plus, we don't care about left most and right most seat, it does not help with or without people sitting there.

Next step becomes, examine each line to see if the line is "bad" so we need to subtract 1 or 2 group from that line. Using bitmask here is really easy.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxNumberOfFamilies(int n, vector<vector<int>>& reservedSeats) {
        int res = 2*n; // ideal situation, each line sits 2 * 4 person group
                       // then we substract illegal ones
        unordered_map<int,char> reserved;
        for(auto seat : reservedSeats){
            if (seat[1] > 1 && seat[1] < 10){ // we don't care about first and last one
                reserved[seat[0]] |= 1<<(seat[1]-2); // change to 0 index base, and minus the first one we don't care
            }
        }
        for(auto r : reserved){
            // p1, p2, p3 = true if that seats are good to be used for the group
            bool p1 = !(r.second & 0b11110000);
            bool p2 = !(r.second & 0b00111100);
            bool p3 = !(r.second & 0b00001111);
            if (p1 && p3){
                continue; // good, the row sits 2 groups
            }
            else if (p1 || p2 || p3){
                res -= 1; // only sits 1 group this row
            }
            else{
                res -= 2; // this row is completely useless
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
