# 447. Number of Boomerangs
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-boomerangs/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3

**notes** 


## Description
Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).

Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).

Example:

Input:
[[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]


## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfBoomerangs(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        int n = points.size();
        int res = 0;
        
        /* use i as the middle point in (i,j,k) dist(i,j) = dist(i,k)
        if i is settled, find all points that have same distance to i, assuming there 
        is x points. then P (lower n)(upper 2) = n(n-1) is the possibilities added to res
        */
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            unordered_map<int,int> m;// dist - cnts
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if (j == i) {
                    continue;
                }
                int dist = (points[i][0]-points[j][0])*(points[i][0]-points[j][0]) 
                    + (points[i][1]-points[j][1])*(points[i][1]-points[j][1]);
                m[dist]++;
            }
            for (auto pair : m){
                res += pair.second*(pair.second-1);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
