**notes** 


## Description
Let's define a function f(s) over a non-empty string s, which calculates the frequency of the smallest character in s. For example, if s = "dcce" then f(s) = 2 because the smallest character is "c" and its frequency is 2.

Now, given string arrays queries and words, return an integer array answer, where each answer[i] is the number of words such that f(queries[i]) < f(W), where W is a word in words.

 

Example 1:

Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: On the first query we have f("cbd") = 1, f("zaaaz") = 3 so f("cbd") < f("zaaaz").
Example 2:

Input: queries = ["bbb","cc"], words = ["a","aa","aaa","aaaa"]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: On the first query only f("bbb") < f("aaaa"). On the second query both f("aaa") and f("aaaa") are both > f("cc").
 

Constraints:

1 <= queries.length <= 2000
1 <= words.length <= 2000
1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10
queries[i][j], words[i][j] are English lowercase letters.

## Solution 1 ?????
Since all strings are limited to 10 characters, we can do two linear scans to detect/count the occurance of the smallest character.

For longer strings, we would do a single scan, counting each of 26 chars.

Also, for a frequency f, we increment positions [0...f - 1] in cnt.

For longer strings, we would only increment position f - 1, and calculate a running sum in cnt in the end.
```c++
vector<int> numSmallerByFrequency(vector<string>& queries, vector<string>& words) {
  auto f = [](string& s) {
    auto min_ch = *min_element(begin(s), end(s));
    return accumulate(begin(s), end(s), 0, [min_ch](int s, char ch) { return s += ch == min_ch ? 1 : 0; });
  };
  vector<int> cnt(11, 0), res;
  for (auto& w : words)
    for (int i = f(w) - 1; i >= 0; --i) ++cnt[i];
  for (auto& q : queries) res.push_back(cnt[f(q)]);
  return res;
}
```
## Solution 2
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int f(string s) {
        if (s.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        char first_char = s[0];
        int res = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s[i] != first_char) {
                break;
            }
            res++;
        }
        return res;
    }
    vector<int> numSmallerByFrequency(vector<string>& queries, vector<string>& words) {
        vector<int> res;
        vector<int> f_queries;
        vector<int> f_words;
        for (auto query : queries) {
            f_queries.push_back(f(query));
        }
        for (auto word : words) {
            f_words.push_back(f(word));
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
            int cur = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < words.size(); j++) {
                if (f_queries[i] < f_words[j]) {
                    cur++;
                }
            }
            res.push_back(cur);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
