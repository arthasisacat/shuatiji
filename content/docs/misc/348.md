## Description

Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.
You may assume the following rules:
A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
Example:
```
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

Could you do better than O(n2) per move() operation?

## Solution O(1)
其实我们只需要追踪每一行的 sum, 每一列的 sum ,以及对角线的 sum 即可.

设 player 1 放在棋盘上是1, player 2 放在棋盘上是-1, 不放棋子是0. 

赢的条件是, 行/列/对角线的和 是-n 或者 n.

```c++
class TicTacToe {
private:
    vector<int> cols; 
    vector<int> rows;
    int diag = 0;
    int antidiag = 0;
    int n = 0;
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    TicTacToe(int n) {
        cols.assign(n, 0);
        rows.assign(n, 0);
        this->n = n;
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ( {row}, {col} ).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    /*
    to add number: player1: 1 ;   player2 : -1
    so either add up to -n or n meaning player1/2 wins
    */
    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int num = (player == 1) ? 1 : -1;
        cols[col] += num;
        rows[row] += num;
        if (row == col) {
            diag += num;
        }
        if ((row + col) == (n - 1)) {
            antidiag += num;
        }
        if (abs(cols[col]) == n ||
            abs(rows[row]) == n ||
            abs(diag) == n ||
            abs(antidiag) == n) {
            return player;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};

/**
 * Your TicTacToe object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TicTacToe obj = new TicTacToe(n);
 * int param_1 = obj.move(row,col,player);
 */
