# 441. Arranging Coins
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
1

**notes** 


## Description
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

## Solution 1
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long sum = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while (1){
            sum += i;
            if (i + 1 + sum > n){
                break;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return i;
    }
};
``` 

## Solution 2: 
use math 
(1+x)*x/2 <= n
