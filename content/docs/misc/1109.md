# 1109. Corporate Flight Bookings
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/corporate-flight-bookings/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes** 
IMPORTANT!!!!


there is another problem that looks exactly the same as this one...but cannot remember the id...

## Description
There are n flights, and they are labeled from 1 to n.

We have a list of flight bookings.  The i-th booking bookings[i] = [i, j, k] means that we booked k seats from flights labeled i to j inclusive.

Return an array answer of length n, representing the number of seats booked on each flight in order of their label.

 

Example 1:

Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
 

Constraints:

1 <= bookings.length <= 20000
1 <= bookings[i][0] <= bookings[i][1] <= n <= 20000
1 <= bookings[i][2] <= 10000
## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> corpFlightBookings(vector<vector<int>>& bookings, int n) {
        /*
        (note that res is 0 index based, but b[0] b[1] is 1 index based.)
        in flight array, for each booking, let's say `b` is the first entry in bookings. 
        x x x x x x x 
          i-----j
        From [i,j] we need to add b[2].
        That is equivalent to:
            - start from i = b[0]-1 (i: 0 index based) we need to add b[2].
            - start from j = b[1] (j: 0 index based) we don't need b[2] any more, so -b[2] for all [j,n)
            special case: if b[1] >= n, we don't need to set j.
        */
        vector<int> res(n,0);
        for (auto b : bookings){
            res[b[0]-1] += b[2];
            if (b[1] < n){
                res[b[1]] += -b[2];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++){
            res[i] += res[i-1];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
