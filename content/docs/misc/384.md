# 384. Shuffle an Array
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/shuffle-an-array/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes** 
Fisher Yates algorithm

similar to [382](/docs/382)

## Description
Shuffle a set of numbers without duplicates.

Example:

// Init an array with set 1, 2, and 3.
int[] nums = {1,2,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// Shuffle the array [1,2,3] and return its result. Any permutation of [1,2,3] must equally likely to be returned.
solution.shuffle();

// Resets the array back to its original configuration [1,2,3].
solution.reset();

// Returns the random shuffling of array [1,2,3].
solution.shuffle();

## Fisher Yates algorithm
[link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shuffle-a-given-array-using-fisher-yates-shuffle-algorithm/)

(different from the link, I pick number for positions left to right. It's actually the same).

for example: 

[1,2,3]
 
 x _ _
first, pick 1 from 1,2,3 and put in to first position (marked as `x`). the P getting picked is 1/3.

Then, 
 x y _
chance for a number to be picked to put at `y` position is 
    P = P_not_picked_at_x * P_picked_at_y 
      = 2/3 * 1/2 
      = 1/3

Last,
 x y z
chance for a number to be put at `z` is
    P = P_not_picked_x * P_not_picked_y * P_picked_at_z 
      = 2/3 * 1/2 * 1
      = 1/3
 
## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
    vector<int> arr;
public:
    Solution(vector<int>& nums) {
        arr = nums;
    }
    
    /** Resets the array to its original configuration and return it. */
    vector<int> reset() {
        return arr;
    }
    
    /** Returns a random shuffling of the array. */
    vector<int> shuffle() {
        vector<int> res = arr;
        int n = arr.size();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            int j = rand()%(n-i)+i; // i <= j <= n-1;
            swap(res[i], res[j]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution* obj = new Solution(nums);
 * vector<int> param_1 = obj->reset();
 * vector<int> param_2 = obj->shuffle();
 */
