# 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3

**notes** 


## Description
We define a harmounious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

Now, given an integer array, you need to find the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
 

Note: The length of the input array will not exceed 20,000.

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findLHS(vector<int>& nums) {
        /* NOTE: subsequence!!! does NOT have to be in order!!! 
        just pick some numbers!!!
        */
        unordered_map<int,int> m; // num - cnt
        for (auto num : nums){
            m[num]++;
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (auto [k,v] : m){
            if (m.count(k-1)) {
                res = max(res, m[k] + m[k-1]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
