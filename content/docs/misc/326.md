# 326. Power of Three
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3

**notes** 
2 solutions.

## Description
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

Example 1:

Input: 27
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: 0
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: 9
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: 45
Output: false
Follow up:
Could you do it without using any loop / recursion?

## Solution 1: math
see [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/discuss/77876/**-A-summary-of-all-solutions-(new-method-included-at-15%3A30pm-Jan-8th)) for discussion about why we use `log10` instead of `log`

but I still don't know why we cannot use `fmod(log10(n), log10(3)) == 0`? - may be because of we cannot
compare double with 0 :

Rather than
```c++
	double a, b;
	...
	if(a == b)	/* WRONG */
```
use something like
```c++
	#include <math.h>
	if(fabs(a - b) <= epsilon * fabs(a))
```
where epsilon is a value chosen to set the degree of 'closeness' (and where you know that a will not be zero). The precise value of epsilon may still have to be chosen with care: its appropriate value may be quite small and related only to the machine's floating-point precision, or it may be larger if the numbers being compared are inherently less accurate or are the results of a chain of calculations which compounds accuracy losses over several steps. (Also, you may have to make the threshold a function of b, or of both a and b.)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return fmod(log10(n)/log10(3), 1) == 0;
    }
};
``` 

## Solution 2: recursion
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        if (n > 1){
            while (n%3 == 0){
                n /= 3;
            }
        }
        return n == 1;
    }
};
```
