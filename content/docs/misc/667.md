**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes** 


## Description
Given two integers n and k, you need to construct a list which contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement:
Suppose this list is [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.
Example 2:
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1, 3, 2]
Explanation: The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
Note:
The n and k are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 104.
## Solution

See [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/beautiful-arrangement-ii/discuss/106948/C%2B%2B-Java-Clean-Code-4-liner)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> constructArray(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> res;
        int i = 1, j = n; 
        bool alter_flag = true;
        while (k > 1){
            if (alter_flag){
                res.push_back(i++);
            }
            else {
                res.push_back(j--);
            }
            k--;
            alter_flag = !alter_flag;
        }
        // cout<<"flag "<<alter_flag<<" i "<<i<<" j "<<j<<endl;
        if (!alter_flag){
            while(j >= i){
                res.push_back(j--);
            }
        }
        else{
            while(j >= i){
                res.push_back(i++);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
