# 985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries

**notes** 
其实很简单。。。不要写复杂了。

## Description
We have an array A of integers, and an array queries of queries.

For the i-th query val = queries[i][0], index = queries[i][1], we add val to A[index].  Then, the answer to the i-th query is the sum of the even values of A.

(Here, the given index = queries[i][1] is a 0-based index, and each query permanently modifies the array A.)

Return the answer to all queries.  Your answer array should have answer[i] as the answer to the i-th query.

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
Output: [8,6,2,4]
Explanation: 
At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to A[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to A[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to A[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to A[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000
-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
1 <= queries.length <= 10000
-10000 <= queries[i][0] <= 10000
0 <= queries[i][1] < A.length

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sumEvenAfterQueries(vector<int>& A, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        int even_sum = accumulate(begin(A), end(A), 0, [](int s, int a) {return s + (a%2 == 0? a : 0);});
        vector<int> res;
        for (auto q : queries) {
            int i = q[1];
            int val = q[0];
            /*
            1. if A[i] was even, subtract it from even_sum
            2. update A[i]
            3. if A[i] is even now, add it back
            */
            if (A[i]%2 == 0) {
                even_sum -= A[i];
            }
            A[i] += val;
            if (A[i]%2 == 0) {
                even_sum += A[i];
            }
            res.push_back(even_sum);
        }
        return res;                                  
    }
};
