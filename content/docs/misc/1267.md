## Description
You are given a map of a server center, represented as a m * n integer matrix grid, where 1 means that on that cell there is a server and 0 means that it is no server. Two servers are said to communicate if they are on the same row or on the same column.

Return the number of servers that communicate with any other server.

 

Example 1:



Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: No servers can communicate with others.
Example 2:



Input: grid = [[1,0],[1,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three servers can communicate with at least one other server.
Example 3:



Input: grid = [[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The two servers in the first row can communicate with each other. The two servers in the third column can communicate with each other. The server at right bottom corner can't communicate with any other server.
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m <= 250
1 <= n <= 250
grid[i][j] == 0 or 1

## Solution
To meet the requirement the server needs to see other servers in same row or same column. 

Thus we can do a preprocessing - save number of servers each row and each col.

For each server at [i,j], if it can talk to other server, that means row i inludes more than 
this server, OR col j includes more than this server. To write it down it's `rows[i] > 1 || cols[j] > 1`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countServers(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
        // 1. preprocessing. save number of servers in each row and col. 
        vector<int> rows(m, 0);
        vector<int> cols(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if (grid[i][j]){
                    rows[i] ++;
                    cols[j] ++;
                }
            }
        }
        // 2. For each server (position [i,j]) if it's row/col has more than 1 servers, then it's not alone. 
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                if (grid[i][j] && (rows[i] > 1 || cols[j] > 1)){
                    res++;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
