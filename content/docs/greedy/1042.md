# 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/flower-planting-with-no-adjacent/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   


## Description
You have N gardens, labelled 1 to N.  In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers.

paths[i] = [x, y] describes the existence of a bidirectional path from garden x to garden y.

Also, there is no garden that has more than 3 paths coming into or leaving it.

Your task is to choose a flower type for each garden such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Return any such a choice as an array answer, where answer[i] is the type of flower planted in the (i+1)-th garden.  The flower types are denoted 1, 2, 3, or 4.  It is guaranteed an answer exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: N = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
Example 2:

Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
Example 3:

Input: N = 4, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 10000
0 <= paths.size <= 20000
No garden has 4 or more paths coming into or leaving it.
It is guaranteed an answer exists.

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> gardenNoAdj(int N, vector<vector<int>>& paths) {
        unordered_map<int, unordered_set<int>> m; // garden - neighbors
        for (auto p : paths){
            // change garden number to 0 index based
            m[p[0]-1].insert(p[1]-1);
            m[p[1]-1].insert(p[0]-1);
        }
        vector<int> flower(N, 0); // 0: no flower assigned
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++){
            // greedily paint one by one, because every node
            // is guaranteed to have <=3 neighbors, it's guaranteed
            // that it has an option.
            vector<bool> color_used(5, false); // 0 is not used
            for (auto neighbor : m[i]) {
                if (flower[neighbor] != 0) {
                    color_used[flower[neighbor]] = true;
                }
            }
            for (int color = 1; color <= 4; color++) {
                if (!color_used[color]) {
                    flower[i] = color;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return flower;
    }
};
