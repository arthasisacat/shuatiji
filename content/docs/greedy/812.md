**notes**   
无聊.

## Description
You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

Example:
Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.


Notes:

3 <= points.length <= 50.
No points will be duplicated.
 -50 <= points[i][j] <= 50.
Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.
 

## Solution
search for how to get area by 3 points. that's it.
3 loops.
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    double largestTriangleArea(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        double res = 0;
        for (auto a : points) {
            for (auto b : points) {
                for (auto c : points) {
                    res = max(res, 0.5 * (a[0]*(b[1]-c[1]) + b[0]*(c[1] - a[1]) + c[0]*(a[1]-b[1])));
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
