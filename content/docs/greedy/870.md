# 870. Advantage Shuffle

**notes**   


## Description
Given two arrays A and B of equal size, the advantage of A with respect to B is the number of indices i for which A[i] > B[i].

Return any permutation of A that maximizes its advantage with respect to B.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [2,7,11,15], B = [1,10,4,11]
Output: [2,11,7,15]
Example 2:

Input: A = [12,24,8,32], B = [13,25,32,11]
Output: [24,32,8,12]
 

Note:

1 <= A.length = B.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
0 <= B[i] <= 10^9

## Solution: GREEDY
1. Sort A
2. Go through B, i = 0 ~n-1
   1. Greedily tried to use smallest possible A[x] that `A[x] > B[i]
   2. if found, great, let's use this A[x] and delete it from A
   3. If not found, use current smallest A[] , and delete it from A
   4. NOTE THAT delete by iterator takes constant time.
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> advantageCount(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        multiset<int> s(A.begin(),A.end()); // sort A
        for (int i = 0; i < B.size(); i++){
            auto p = s.upper_bound(B[i]); // find smallest number in A that is larger than B[i]
            if (p == s.end()){ // no such number
                p = s.begin();
            }
            A[i] = *p;
            s.erase(p); // erase by iterator takes constant time
        }
        return A;
    }
};
```
