# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   
First problem in buy stocks series! :)

## Description
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
```
Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```
## Solution
This is the first problem in buy and sell stocks series. 
First one is simple & naive - only have one chance to buy then sell, thus
we want to save min as we go through the prices, then keep comparing `prices[cur] - min`
with res.
Only thing to note is if prices are `[5,4,3,2,1]`, best policy would be buying and selling at the same 
day, thus return 0.
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int min = INT_MAX;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] < min) {
                min = prices[i];
            }
            else {
                res = max(res, prices[i] - min);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
