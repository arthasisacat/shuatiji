# 948. Bag of Tokens
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/bag-of-tokens/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**   


## Description
You have an initial power P, an initial score of 0 points, and a bag of tokens.

Each token can be used at most once, has a value token[i], and has potentially two ways to use it.

If we have at least token[i] power, we may play the token face up, losing token[i] power, and gaining 1 point.
If we have at least 1 point, we may play the token face down, gaining token[i] power, and losing 1 point.
Return the largest number of points we can have after playing any number of tokens.

 

Example 1:

Input: tokens = [100], P = 50
Output: 0
Example 2:

Input: tokens = [100,200], P = 150
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], P = 200
Output: 2
 

Note:

tokens.length <= 1000
0 <= tokens[i] < 10000
0 <= P < 10000

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int bagOfTokensScore(vector<int>& tokens, int P) {
        /* smallest token to buy points, and use largest token to sell points to gain power.
        */
        sort(tokens.begin(), tokens.end());
        int res = 0, point = 0, power = P;
        int i = 0, j = tokens.size()-1;
        while (i <= j){
            if (power >= tokens[i]){
                power -= tokens[i++];
                res = max(res, ++point);
            }
            else if (point > 0){
                point --;
                power += tokens[j--];

            }
            else{
                break;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
