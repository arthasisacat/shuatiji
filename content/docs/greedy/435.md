# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
Example 2:

Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
Example 3:

Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
 

Note:

You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

## Solution
```c++
/* classic greedy scheduling:
this problem is translated to: what's the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals?
then min number we need to remove = intervals.size() - cnt
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        if (intervals.size() <= 1){
            return 0;
        }
        // sort ascendingly by end time
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const vector<int>&a, const vector<int>&b){
            return (a[1] == b[1]) ? (a[0] < b[0]) : (a[1] < b[1]);
        });
        
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int cnt = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); i++){
            if (intervals[i][0] >= end){
                cnt++;
                end = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        return intervals.size()-cnt;            
    }
};
```
