# 910. Smallest Range II

**notes**   


## Description

Given an array A of integers, for each integer A[i] we need to choose either x = -K or x = K, and add x to A[i] (only once).

After this process, we have some array B.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of B and the minimum value of B.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [1], K = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: B = [1]
Example 2:

Input: A = [0,10], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: B = [2,8]
Example 3:

Input: A = [1,3,6], K = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: B = [4,6,3]
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 10000
0 <= K <= 10000

## Solution
1. sort array.
2. worst case, all +k or all -k, then the max diff is largest number - smallest number (A[n-1] - A[0])
3. Now array is sorted, we want to find a partition point i, so that A[i]+K and A[i+1]-K will be very close. save the closest situation, which is our result.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestRangeII(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        int n = A.size();
        sort(A.begin(), A.end());
        int res = A[n-1] - A[0]; // all +k or all -k
        int l = A[0]+K, r = A[n-1]-K;
        // i: the partition point that on left (including A[i]) +K, right side -K
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++){
            int maxi = max(r, A[i]+K);
            int mini = min(l, A[i+1]-K);
            res = min(res, maxi-mini);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
