## Description
There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.

An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

Example:

Input:
[[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).
 

## Solution
```c++
/*
Idea:
We know that eventually we have to shoot down every balloon,
so for each ballon there must be an arrow whose position is 
between balloon[0] and balloon[1] inclusively. Given that, 
we can sort the array of balloons by their ending position. 
Then we make sure that while we take care of each balloon 
in order, we can shoot as many following balloons as possible.

So what position should we pick each time? We should shoot 
as to the right as possible, because since balloons are 
sorted, this gives you the best chance to take down more 
balloons. Therefore the position should always 
be balloon[i][1] for the ith balloon.

class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        if (points.size() <= 1){
            return points.size();
        }
        // sort ascendingly by end position
        sort(points.begin(), points.end(), [](const vector<int>& a, const vector<int>& b){
            return a[1] < b[1]; 
        });
        
        int res = 1;
        int p = points[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < points.size(); i++){
            if (p >= points[i][0]){
                continue;
            }
            else{
                res++;
                p = points[i][1];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
