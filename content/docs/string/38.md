# 38. Count and Say
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   
boring

## Description
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.
Given an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
Example 1:
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Example 2:
Input: 4
Output: "1211"


## Solution

boring. 就是数数,有 x 个 y, 然后 string 后面就加上"xy"

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        string res = "1";
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            res = helper(res); // feed last one in, get new string out
        }
        return res;
    }
    
    string helper(string s) {
        string res;
        int cnt = 1;
        int i = 1;
        while (i <= s.length()) {            
            if (i == s.length() || s[i] != s[i-1]) {
                res += to_string(cnt) + s[i-1];
                cnt = 1;
            }
            else {
                cnt++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
