## Description

Given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome
Example 2:

Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
Example 3:

Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
Example 4:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
s only consists of letters 'a' and 'b'

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removePalindromeSub(string s) {
        /* because it only has a and b, max operation is 2 steps:
        step 1: remove all a
        step 2: remove all b
        exception is
        1. s is empty -> 0
        2. s is palindrome -> 1
        */
        if (s.size() == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        if (s == string(s.rbegin(), s.rend())){
            return 1;
        }
        return 2;
    }
};
```
