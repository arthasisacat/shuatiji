## Description
We have a string S of lowercase letters, and an integer array shifts.

Call the shift of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). 

For example, shift('a') = 'b', shift('t') = 'u', and shift('z') = 'a'.

Now for each shifts[i] = x, we want to shift the first i+1 letters of S, x times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to S are applied.

Example 1:

Input: S = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
Output: "rpl"
Explanation: 
We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters of S by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters of S by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters of S by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.
Note:

1 <= S.length = shifts.length <= 20000
0 <= shifts[i] <= 10 ^ 9

## Solution

Take `S = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]` as example. 

first letter `a` needs to shift 3+5+9 times; second letter `b` needs to shift 5+9 times; third letter `c` needs to shift 9 times.

Basic logic:

If we go from right side to left side, then let's use `cnt` to record times current letter needs to be shifted, then it's initialized to 0, and will be 9 for letter `c`. then for `b`, `cnt + 5`. For `a`, `cnt += 3`.

Things to notice:

Handling overflow! remember that if cnt == 26, this means no shift. example: for letter `a`, shift 25 times means it becomes `z`.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string shiftingLetters(string S, vector<int>& shifts) {
        string res = S;
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = S.size()-1; i >= 0; i--){
            cnt = (cnt + shifts[i]) %26;
            if (res[i]-'a'+cnt >= 26){
                res[i] = res[i] + cnt - 26;
            }
            else{
                res[i] = res[i] + cnt;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
