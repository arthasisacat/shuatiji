# 820. Short Encoding of Words
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/short-encoding-of-words/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**   


## Description
Given a list of words, we may encode it by writing a reference string S and a list of indexes A.

For example, if the list of words is ["time", "me", "bell"], we can write it as S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].

Then for each index, we will recover the word by reading from the reference string from that index until we reach a "#" character.

What is the length of the shortest reference string S possible that encodes the given words?

Example:

Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: S = "time#bell#" and indexes = [0, 2, 5].
 

Note:

1 <= words.length <= 2000.
1 <= words[i].length <= 7.
Each word has only lowercase letters.

## Solution
Add all words to a hash set first. Then removing words if they are suffix of longer words. The returning lengths should be (each remaining word length +1) (each needs to add 1!)
To do this, simply remove all suffix of the word from the hash set because if they are suffix then they can be replaced by current (longer) word.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumLengthEncoding(vector<string>& words) {
        unordered_set<string> s(words.begin(), words.end());
        for(auto w : s){
            for (int i = 1; i < w.size(); i++){
                // if w[i:end] (w.substr(i)) exists and also is a word, it is
                // a suffix of w and can be represented by w.
                s.erase(w.substr(i));
            }
        }
        int res = 0; 
        for (auto w : s){
            res += w.length()+1;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
