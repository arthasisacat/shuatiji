## Description
Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, you need to return the calculation result in string format. The final result should be irreducible fraction. If your final result is an integer, say 2, you need to change it to the format of fraction that has denominator 1. So in this case, 2 should be converted to 2/1.

Example 1:
Input:"-1/2+1/2"
Output: "0/1"
Example 2:
Input:"-1/2+1/2+1/3"
Output: "1/3"
Example 3:
Input:"1/3-1/2"
Output: "-1/6"
Example 4:
Input:"5/3+1/3"
Output: "2/1"
Note:
The input string only contains '0' to '9', '/', '+' and '-'. So does the output.
Each fraction (input and output) has format ±numerator/denominator. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then '+' will be omitted.
The input only contains valid irreducible fractions, where the numerator and denominator of each fraction will always be in the range [1,10]. If the denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.
The number of given fractions will be in the range [1,10].
The numerator and denominator of the final result are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of 32-bit int.

Conversion between strings and numbers

Because the insertion and extraction operators know how to work with all of the basic data types, we can use them in order to convert strings to numbers or vice versa.

First, let’s take a look at converting numbers into a string:

```c++
std::stringstream os;
 
int nValue{ 12345 };
double dValue{ 67.89 };
os << nValue << ' ' << dValue;
 
std::string strValue1, strValue2;
os >> strValue1 >> strValue2;
 
std::cout << strValue1 << ' ' << strValue2 << '\n';
```

This snippet prints:

12345 67.89

Now let’s convert a numerical string to a number:

```c++
std::stringstream os;
os << "12345 67.89"; // insert a string of numbers into the stream
int nValue;
double dValue;
 
os >> nValue >> dValue;
 
cout << nValue << ' ' << dValue << '\n';
```

This program prints:

12345 67.89

Now back to our problem, `-1/2+3/4`

Make initial A = 0, B = 1. (This is important!)

then use `iss >> a >> tmp >> b` to get a, b. note a is -1, b is 2, tmp is `/` 
that we don't care. 

every time, we're using the calculated `A/B` to add new `a/b`.

Note: make sure get absolute vallue of __gcd otherwise it might be negative. A = -1, 
B = 6, __gcd(A,B) = -1. not what we want!


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string fractionAddition(string expression) {
        istringstream iss(expression);
        int A = 0, B = 1;
        int a,b;
        char tmp;
        while (iss >> a>>tmp>>b){
            // A/B + a/b = (A*b + B*a)/(Bb)
            A = A*b + B*a;
            B = B*b;
            int gcd = abs(__gcd(A,B)); // use abs() to keep B = Bb positive!
            A /= gcd;
            B /= gcd;            
        }
        return to_string(A)+"/"+to_string(B);
    }
};
```
