# 165. Compare Version Numbers

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**   
use of istringstream and >>, and its return value

## Description

Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 > version2 return 1; if version1 < version2 return -1;otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.

The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be 0. For example, version number 3.4 has a revision number of 3 and 4 for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1
Example 2:

Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
Output: -1
Example 4:

Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both “01” and “001" represent the same number “1”
Example 5:

Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first version number does not have a third level revision number, which means its third level revision number is default to "0"
 

Note:

Version strings are composed of numeric strings separated by dots . and this numeric strings may have leading zeroes.
Version strings do not start or end with dots, and they will not be two consecutive dots.

## Solution 1
`bool(iss1>>v1) + bool(iss2>>v2)` will be true if *any* v1 and v2 have content.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int compareVersion(string version1, string version2) {
        istringstream iss1(version1);
        istringstream iss2(version2);
        int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;
        char c;
        
        while(bool(iss1>>v1) + bool(iss2>>v2)){
            if (v1 != v2){
                return (v1 > v2) ? 1 : -1;
            }
            iss1 >> c; // consume '.'
            iss2 >> c; // consume '.'
            // reset
            v1 = 0;
            v2 = 0;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```

## Solution 2
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int compareVersion(string version1, string version2) {
        int res = 0;
        istringstream iss1(version1);
        istringstream iss2(version2);
        while (1){
            string s1, s2;
            getline(iss1, s1, '.');
            getline(iss2, s2, '.');
            int tmp1 = s1.size() > 0 ? stoi(s1): 0;
            int tmp2 = s2.size() > 0 ? stoi(s2): 0;
            // cout<<s1<<" "<<s2<<endl;
            if (s1.size() == 0 && s2.size() == 0){
                break;
            }
            if (tmp1 > tmp2){
                return 1;
            }
            else if (tmp1 < tmp2){
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```
