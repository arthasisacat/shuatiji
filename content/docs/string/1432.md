# 1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-difference-you-can-get-from-changing-an-integer/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4.5

**notes**   


## Description
You are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps exactly two times:

Pick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9).
Pick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). The digit y can be equal to x.
Replace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y.
The new integer cannot have any leading zeros, also the new integer cannot be 0.
Let a and b be the results of applying the operations to num the first and second times, respectively.

Return the max difference between a and b.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 555
Output: 888
Explanation: The first time pick x = 5 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 5 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 999 and b = 111 and max difference = 888
Example 2:

Input: num = 9
Output: 8
Explanation: The first time pick x = 9 and y = 9 and store the new integer in a.
The second time pick x = 9 and y = 1 and store the new integer in b.
We have now a = 9 and b = 1 and max difference = 8
Example 3:

Input: num = 123456
Output: 820000
Example 4:

Input: num = 10000
Output: 80000
Example 5:

Input: num = 9288
Output: 8700
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 10^8


## Solution
find min and max, the difference will be maximized.

max is easy: from left to right, find first number that is not 9, then replace it (all its occurances) with 9

min: 
    - if first number is 1, then we cannot change it to smaller (0). so, find fisrt non 1 && non 0 (because 0 is small enough) number and replace it (and all its occurances) with 0.
    - if first number is not 1, then it's >1. replace it (and all its occurances) with 1. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDiff(int num) {
        string s = to_string(num);        
        // replace all occurances of first char that is not in excludes with c
        auto f = [](string str, string excludes, char c){
            auto pos = str.find_first_not_of(excludes);
            if (pos != string::npos){
                char tmp = str[pos];
                replace(str.begin(), str.end(), tmp, c);
            }
            return stoi(str);
        };
        int mx = f(s, "9", '9');
        
        // s[0] == '1' replace occurances of first non '1' non '1' character with '0'
        // s[0] > '1' replace occurances of s[0] with '1'
        int mn = (s[0] == '1') ? f(s, "01", '0') : f(s, "1", '1');
        return mx - mn;
    }
};
```
