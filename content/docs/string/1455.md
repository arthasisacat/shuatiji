## Description

Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord.

You have to check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

Return the index of the word in sentence where searchWord is a prefix of this word (1-indexed).

If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

A prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous substring of S.

 

Example 1:

Input: sentence = "i love eating burger", searchWord = "burg"
Output: 4
Explanation: "burg" is prefix of "burger" which is the 4th word in the sentence.
Example 2:

Input: sentence = "this problem is an easy problem", searchWord = "pro"
Output: 2
Explanation: "pro" is prefix of "problem" which is the 2nd and the 6th word in the sentence, but we return 2 as it's the minimal index.
Example 3:

Input: sentence = "i am tired", searchWord = "you"
Output: -1
Explanation: "you" is not a prefix of any word in the sentence.
Example 4:

Input: sentence = "i use triple pillow", searchWord = "pill"
Output: 4
Example 5:

Input: sentence = "hello from the other side", searchWord = "they"
Output: -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= sentence.length <= 100
1 <= searchWord.length <= 10
sentence consists of lowercase English letters and spaces.
searchWord consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    // return true if s is word's prefix
    bool is_prefix(string s, string word){
        int n1 = s.size();
        int n2 = word.size();
        if (n1 == 0){
            return true;
        }
        if (n2 < n1){
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++){
            if (s[i] != word[i]){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    int isPrefixOfWord(string sentence, string searchWord) {
        istringstream iss(sentence);
        string tmp;
        int i = 1; // 1-based!
        while (iss >> tmp){
            if (is_prefix(searchWord, tmp)){
                return i;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
