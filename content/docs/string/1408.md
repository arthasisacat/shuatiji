## Description

Given an array of string words. Return all strings in words which is substring of another word in any order. 

String words[i] is substring of words[j], if can be obtained removing some characters to left and/or right side of words[j].

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]
Explanation: "as" is substring of "mass" and "hero" is substring of "superhero".
["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode".
Example 3:

Input: words = ["blue","green","bu"]
Output: []
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length <= 30
words[i] contains only lowercase English letters.
It's guaranteed that words[i] will be unique.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> stringMatching(vector<string>& words) {
        vector<string> res;
        for(auto w: words){
            for(auto i :words){
                if(i == w){
                    continue;
                }
                if(i.find(w) != -1){
                    res.push_back(w);
                    break; // break to avoid duplicate, this w is already good no need to continue
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
