# 1324. Print Words Vertically
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/print-words-vertically/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
3

**notes**   
好无聊。。

## Description
Given a string s. Return all the words vertically in the same order in which they appear in s.
Words are returned as a list of strings, complete with spaces when is necessary. (Trailing spaces are not allowed).
Each word would be put on only one column and that in one column there will be only one word.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "HOW ARE YOU"
Output: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]
Explanation: Each word is printed vertically. 
 "HAY"
 "ORO"
 "WEU"
Example 2:

Input: s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
Output: ["TBONTB","OEROOE","   T"]
Explanation: Trailing spaces is not allowed. 
"TBONTB"
"OEROOE"
"   T"
Example 3:

Input: s = "CONTEST IS COMING"
Output: ["CIC","OSO","N M","T I","E N","S G","T"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 200
s contains only upper case English letters.
It's guaranteed that there is only one space between 2 words.

## Solution
1. 最长的word就是res的行数。
2. 一个一个word 竖着填到res中
3. 注意最后需要把每行最后没用的空格删除！


```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> printVertically(string s) {
        istringstream iss(s);
        string cur;
        int longest = 0;
        while (iss >> cur){
            longest = max(longest,(int)cur.size());
        }
        vector<string> res(longest);
        istringstream
        while (iss >> cur){
            int j = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < longest; i++){
                if (j == cur.size()){
                    res[i] += " ";
                }
                else {
                    res[i] += cur[j];
                    j++;
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < longest; i++){
            while (res[i].back() == ' '){
                res[i].pop_back();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
