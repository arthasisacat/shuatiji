# 1371. Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts

5

**notes**   
insane.

## Description
Given the string s, return the size of the longest substring containing each vowel an even number of times. That is, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' must appear an even number of times.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
Output: 13
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetminicowor" which contains two each of the vowels: e, i and o and zero of the vowels: a and u.
Example 2:

Input: s = "leetcodeisgreat"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetc" which contains two e's.
Example 3:

Input: s = "bcbcbc"
Output: 6
Explanation: In this case, the given string "bcbcbc" is the longest because all vowels: a, e, i, o and u appear zero times.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^5
s contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findTheLongestSubstring(string s) {
        /* use bitmask `cur` to save the parity situation for aeiou. 
        Let's say at index j we have cur = 10100 (1:odd, 0:even)
        we want to find the smallest i that have the same cur = 10100, then s[i~j] must have all even
        vowels. thus, use m[cur] to save the earliest appearance of each `cur`(bitmask).
        */
        unordered_map<int,int> m; // cur(parity situation in a bitmask for aeiou) - earliest appearance index
        // for all even situation, the best and existing one is when i = -1, 
        // nothing included. no future i will beats it. it provides the min (and best) position as -1.
        m[0] = -1; 
        int cur = 0, res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            // flip corresponding bit, 0 even, 1 odd
            // if no find, find return 0, so it's (1<<(-1+1))>>1 = 0, cur xor 0 = cur
            cur ^= (1 << (string("aeiou").find(s[i])+1)) >> 1; 
            if (!m.count(cur)){
                m[cur] = i;
            }
            res = max(res, i - m[cur]);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
