# 443. String Compression
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/)

**difficulty(1-5)**

**notes**   


## Description
Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

 
Follow up:
Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

 
Example 1:

Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
 

Example 2:

Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
 

Example 3:

Input:
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

Output:
Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

Explanation:
Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
 

Note:

All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int compress(vector<char>& chars) {
        char prev = chars[0];
        int cnt = 1;
        int j = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < chars.size(); i++){
            if (chars[i] == prev){
                cnt++;
            }
            else{
                // counting previous one
                if (cnt > 1){
                    string tmp = to_string(cnt);
                    for (auto c : tmp){
                        chars[j++] = c;
                    }
                }
                // counting new one's one char
                chars[j++] = chars[i];
                cnt = 1;
                prev = chars[i];
            }
        }
        // dealing with last cnt
        if (cnt > 1){
            string tmp = to_string(cnt);
            for (auto c : tmp){
                chars[j++] = c;
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
};
```
