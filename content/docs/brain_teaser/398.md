**notes**

## Description
Given an array of integers with possible duplicates, randomly output the index of a given target number. You can assume that the given target number must exist in the array.

Note:
The array size can be very large. Solution that uses too much extra space will not pass the judge.

Example:

int[] nums = new int[] {1,2,3,3,3};
Solution solution = new Solution(nums);

// pick(3) should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
solution.pick(3);

// pick(1) should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
solution.pick(1);

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
private:
    vector<int> arr;
public:
    Solution(vector<int>& nums) {
        arr = nums;
    }
    
    /*     idx = i
                 |
        A A A ...A
        1 2 3 .. n
                 
        For nth number that is equal to target, chance to replace it with existing res is 1/n. thus if rand()%n == 0 (chance is 1/n) 
        replace res with current index i
        
        n = 1, chance to set res = i is 1
        n = 2, chance to set res = i is 1/2
        n = 3, chance to set res = i is 1/3...
    */
    int pick(int target) {
        int res = -1;
        int n = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++){
            if (arr[i] != target){
                continue;
            }
            n++;
            if (rand()%n == 0){
                res = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};

/**
 * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * Solution* obj = new Solution(nums);
 * int param_1 = obj->pick(target);
