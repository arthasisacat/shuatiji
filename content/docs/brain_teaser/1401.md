# 1401. Circle and Rectangle Overlapping
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/circle-and-rectangle-overlapping/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
4

**notes**

## Description
Given a circle represented as (radius, x_center, y_center) and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as (x1, y1, x2, y2), where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle.

Return True if the circle and rectangle are overlapped otherwise return False.

In other words, check if there are any point (xi, yi) such that belongs to the circle and the rectangle at the same time.

 

Example 1:



Input: radius = 1, x_center = 0, y_center = 0, x1 = 1, y1 = -1, x2 = 3, y2 = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Circle and rectangle share the point (1,0) 
Example 2:



Input: radius = 1, x_center = 0, y_center = 0, x1 = -1, y1 = 0, x2 = 0, y2 = 1
Output: true
Example 3:



Input: radius = 1, x_center = 1, y_center = 1, x1 = -3, y1 = -3, x2 = 3, y2 = 3
Output: true
Example 4:

Input: radius = 1, x_center = 1, y_center = 1, x1 = 1, y1 = -3, x2 = 2, y2 = -1
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= radius <= 2000
-10^4 <= x_center, y_center, x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 10^4
x1 < x2
y1 < y2

## Solution
```c++
/*
move rectagle's coordinates origin to circle's center. 
the problem is asking, if distance from closest 
point (x,y) ( x1 <= x <= x2, y1 <= y <= y2) to
origin <= radius.
closest point has min x*x and min y*y
*/
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkOverlap(int radius, int x_center, int y_center, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        x1 -= x_center; 
        x2 -= x_center;
        y1 -= y_center;
        y2 -= y_center;
        int min_x_sq = x1*x2 < 0 ? 0 : min(x1*x1, x2*x2);
        int min_y_sq = y1*y2 < 0 ? 0 : min(y1*y1, y2*y2);
        return (min_x_sq + min_y_sq) <= (radius*radius);
    }
};
```
