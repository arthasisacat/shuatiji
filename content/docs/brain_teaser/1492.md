**notes**   


## Description

Given two positive integers n and k.

A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.

Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.
Example 2:

Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.
Example 3:

Input: n = 4, k = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.
Example 4:

Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Factors list is [1], the 1st factor is 1.
Example 5:

Input: n = 1000, k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000].
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= n <= 1000

## Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> factor_l2r;
        vector<int> factor_r2l;
        for(int i = 1; i*i <= n; i++){
            if(n%i == 0){
                factor_l2r.push_back(i);
                if(i*i != n){
                    factor_r2l.insert(factor_r2l.begin(), n/i);
                }
            }
        }
        if (k > (factor_l2r.size() + factor_r2l.size())){
            return -1;
        }
        if (k <= factor_l2r.size()){
            return factor_l2r[k-1];
        }
        return factor_r2l[k-factor_l2r.size()-1];
    }
};
```
