# 390. Elimination Game
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/elimination-game/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**

## Description
There is a list of sorted integers from 1 to n. Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.

Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the right most number and every other number from the remaining numbers.

We keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Find the last number that remains starting with a list of length n.

Example:

Input:
n = 9,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2 4 6 8
2 6
6

Output:
6

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    /* key: 
    After first elimination, all the numbers left are even numbers.
    Divide by 2, we get a continuous new sequence from 1 to n / 2.
    For this sequence we start from right to left as the first elimination.
    Then the original result should be two times the mirroring result of lastRemaining(n / 2).
    
    L(1..n): the number that is retained by deleting first from left to right for 1~n
    R(1..n): the number that is retained by deleting from right to left for 1~n
    
    L(1..n) + L(n..1) = n+1
    =>
    L(1..n) + R(1..n) = n+1
    =>
    L(1..n/2) + R(1..n/2) = n/2 + 1
    */
    int lastRemaining(int n) {
        return (n == 1) ? 1 : 2*(1 + n/2 - lastRemaining(n/2));
    }
};
```
