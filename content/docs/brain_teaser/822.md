## Description
On a table are N cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different).

We flip any number of cards, and after we choose one card. 

If the number X on the back of the chosen card is not on the front of any card, then this number X is good.

What is the smallest number that is good?  If no number is good, output 0.

Here, fronts[i] and backs[i] represent the number on the front and back of card i. 

A flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.

Example:

Input: fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: If we flip the second card, the fronts are [1,3,4,4,7] and the backs are [1,2,4,1,3].
We choose the second card, which has number 2 on the back, and it isn't on the front of any card, so 2 is good.
 

Note:

1 <= fronts.length == backs.length <= 1000.
1 <= fronts[i] <= 2000.
1 <= backs[i] <= 2000.

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int flipgame(vector<int>& fronts, vector<int>& backs) {
        int res = INT_MAX;
        unordered_set<int> same;
        for (int i = 0; i < fronts.size(); i++){
            if (fronts[i] == backs[i]){
                same.insert(fronts[i]);
            }
        }
        for (auto num : fronts){
            if (!same.count(num)){
                res = min(res, num);
            }
        }
        for (auto num : backs){
            if (!same.count(num)){
                res = min(res, num);
            }
        }
        return res == INT_MAX ? 0 : res;
    }
};
```
