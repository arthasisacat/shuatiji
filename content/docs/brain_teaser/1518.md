**notes**   


## Description

Given numBottles full water bottles, you can exchange numExchange empty water bottles for one full water bottle.

The operation of drinking a full water bottle turns it into an empty bottle.

Return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

 

Example 1:

![pic](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/01/sample_1_1875.png)

Input: numBottles = 9, numExchange = 3
Output: 13
Explanation: You can exchange 3 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle.
Number of water bottles you can drink: 9 + 3 + 1 = 13.
Example 2:



Input: numBottles = 15, numExchange = 4
Output: 19
Explanation: You can exchange 4 empty bottles to get 1 full water bottle. 
Number of water bottles you can drink: 15 + 3 + 1 = 19.
Example 3:

Input: numBottles = 5, numExchange = 5
Output: 6
Example 4:

Input: numBottles = 2, numExchange = 3
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= numBottles <= 100
2 <= numExchange <= 100

## Solution
1. drink water from numBottles, thse bottles become emptyBottles
2. collect empty bottles and become numBottles, drink them. go back to step 1.
excecute 1 & 2 until no numBottles and not enough emptyBottles to turn to numBottles.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numWaterBottles(int numBottles, int numExchange) {
        int res = 0;
        int emptyBottles = 0;
        while(numBottles || (emptyBottles >= numExchange)){
            if (numBottles > 0){
                res += numBottles;
                emptyBottles += numBottles;
                numBottles = 0;
            }
            if (emptyBottles >= numExchange){
                numBottles = emptyBottles/numExchange;
                emptyBottles = emptyBottles % numExchange;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
