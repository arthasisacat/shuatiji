**notes**   
Good!! and hard!

## Description

Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to N.

Recall that a number is prime if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it is greater than 1. 

For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.

Recall that a number is a palindrome if it reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left. 

For example, 12321 is a palindrome.

 

Example 1:

Input: 6
Output: 7
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 11
Example 3:

Input: 13
Output: 101
 

Note:

1 <= N <= 10^8
The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than 2 * 10^8.

## Solution
Reference [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-palindrome/discuss/146798/JavaC%2B%2BPython-All-Even-Length-Palindrome-are-Divisible-by-11)

1. all even length palindrome is divisable by 11 (e.g. 1234321). Among them, 11 is the only prime. handle N= 8,9,10,11 case as special case
2. Only need to consider odd length palindrome. to construct odd length palindrom, we could set i ~ [1,100000], for example i = 178 then construct palindrom like "17871" and check if the constructed number is prime. 
3. Why 1000000? 1 <= N <= 10^8, thus max i = 99999 will construct 99999 99999 enough to cover N's range. If i = 9999 , palindrom is 9999 9999 missing 1 0000 0000. 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool is_prime(int num){
        if(num < 2 || num%2 == 0){
            return num == 2;
        }
        for (int i = 3; i*i <= num; i++){
            if(num%i == 0){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    int primePalindrome(int N) {
        if (N > 7 && N <= 11){
            return 11;
        }
        for(int i = 1; i < 100000; i++){
            string s1 = to_string(i);
            string s2 = string(s1.rbegin(), s1.rend());
            string s= s1 + s2.substr(1);
            int num = stoi(s);
            if(num >= N && is_prime(num)){
                return num;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
