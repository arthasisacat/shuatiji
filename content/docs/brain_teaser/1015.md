太难了.T.T

## Description

Given a positive integer K, you need find the smallest positive integer N such that N is divisible by K, and N only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of N.  If there is no such N, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.
 

Note:

1 <= K <= 10^5

## Solution
Trying 1,11,111, 1111, 11111... is impossible because it can have hundreds of digits of 1. (also doing devision is slow when number is too big).

Instead, use modular operation.
```
111%3 == 0 
111 = 11*10+1

111%3 = (11*10+1)%3 = ((11%3)*10+1)%3 
```
(see [modular](mod))

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        int num = 0;
        for(int n = 1; n <= K; n++){
            num = (num*10+1)%K;
            if (num == 0){
                return n;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
