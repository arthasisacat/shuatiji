# 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
5

**notes**

## Description
On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north.  The robot can receive one of three instructions:

"G": go straight 1 unit;
"L": turn 90 degrees to the left;
"R": turn 90 degress to the right.
The robot performs the instructions given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return true if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

 

Example 1:

Input: "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
Example 2:

Input: "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: 
The robot moves north indefinitely.
Example 3:

Input: "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...
 

Note:

1 <= instructions.length <= 100
instructions[i] is in {'G', 'L', 'R'}

## Solution
Bounded by circle means:
after one round of move, either distance moved is 0, OR direction is not NORTH
```c++
class Solution {
private:
    // turn right: +1, turn left (-1 + 4)%4
    enum {
        NORTH = 0,
        EAST = 1,
        SOUTH = 2,
        WEST = 3,
    };
public:
    bool isRobotBounded(string instructions) {
        int dir = NORTH;
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        for (auto c : instructions){
            switch(c){
                case 'G':
                    switch(dir){
                        case NORTH:
                            y++;
                            break;
                        case EAST:
                            x++;
                            break;
                        case SOUTH:
                            y--;
                            break;
                        case WEST:
                            x--;
                            break;
                    }
                    break;
                case 'L':
                    dir--;
                    if (dir < 0){
                        dir = WEST;
                    }
                    break;
                case 'R':
                    dir++;
                    if (dir > 3){
                        dir = NORTH;
                    }
                    break;
            }
            // cout<<"dir "<<dir<<" x "<<x<<" y "<<y<<endl;
        }
        return (x== 0 && y == 0) || dir != NORTH;
    }
};
```
