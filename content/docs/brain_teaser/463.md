# 463. Island Perimeter
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   
see Solution for quick calculation. 

## Description
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

 

Example:

Input:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]

Output: 16

Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the 

## Solution
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int islandPerimeter(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        /*
        1. not consider connection between lands, 1 land produce 4 lines for perimeter
        2. if each two land connection, perimeter - 2. 
        
        Note: do not recalculate connection, for [i][j], only look at [i-1][j] and [i][j-1],
        OR look at [i+1][j] and [i][j+1]. Don't look at all four direction, other wise there
        will be duplicate when calculate! (e.g. [1][1] looks at [1][0] and [1][0] looks back
        to [1][1])
        */
        int land = 0;
        int connect = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    land ++;
                    if (i > 0 && grid[i-1][j] == 1) {
                        connect ++;
                    }
                    if (j > 0 && grid[i][j-1] == 1) {
                        connect ++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return (4 * land - 2 * connect);
    }
};
```
