## Description
We have a two dimensional matrix A where each value is 0 or 1.

A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column: changing all 0s to 1s, and all 1s to 0s.

After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.

Return the highest possible score.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 39
Explanation:
Toggled to [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].
0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 20
1 <= A[0].length <= 20
A[i][j] is 0 or 1.

## Solution
Assuming A has m rows and n cols. 
1. first bit is worth `1<<(n-1)`, so for each row's first bit (`A[i][0]`]) we will flip the row so that it's first bit is 1. This means all bits in that row `A[i][j]` whose value is equal to `A[i][0]` now will be 1.
2. For col `j = [1, n-1]`, if cnt of 1s > 0s, then just use it, otherwise flip this col. So cnts of 1s should be max(cnt, m-cnt). each col worth `1<<(n-j-1)`.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int matrixScore(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        int m = A.size(), n = A[0].size();
        int res = m*(1<<(n-1)); // assuming all first col is flipped to 1
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++){
            int cnt = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
                cnt += (A[i][j] == A[i][0]);
            }
            res += max(cnt, m-cnt) * (1<<(n-j-1));
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
