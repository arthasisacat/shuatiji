## Description
We have some permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N - 1], where N is the length of A.

The number of (global) inversions is the number of i < j with 0 <= i < j < N and A[i] > A[j].

The number of local inversions is the number of i with 0 <= i < N and A[i] > A[i+1].

Return true if and only if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.

Example 1:

Input: A = [1,0,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is 1 global inversion, and 1 local inversion.
Example 2:

Input: A = [1,2,0]
Output: false
Explanation: There are 2 global inversions, and 1 local inversion.
Note:

A will be a permutation of [0, 1, ..., A.length - 1].
A will have length in range [1, 5000].
The time limit for this problem has been reduced.

## Solution
```
All local inversions are global inversions.
If the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions,
it means that all global inversions in permutations are local inversions.
It also means that we can not find A[i] > A[j] with i+2<=j.
In other words, max(A[i]) < A[i+2]

In this first solution, I traverse A and keep the current biggest number cmax.
Then I check the condition cmax < A[i+2]
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isIdealPermutation(vector<int>& A) {
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++){
            // for any number i, it can only be placed on i-1, i, i+1 (3 positions)
            if (abs(A[i]-i) > 1){
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```
