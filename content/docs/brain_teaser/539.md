**notes**

## Description
Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "Hour:Minutes" format, find the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.
Example 1:
Input: ["23:59","00:00"]
Output: 1
Note:
The number of time points in the given list is at least 2 and won't exceed 20000.
The input time is legal and ranges from 00:00 to 23:59.

## Solution
Smart part: 
Don't care about if the result 11:59 ~ 12:00, calculate as is and then use 1440 to subtract it. 
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinDifference(vector<string>& timePoints) {
        sort(timePoints.begin(), timePoints.end());
        int res = INT_MAX;
        int n = timePoints.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            int diff = get_diff(timePoints[(i-1+n)%n],timePoints[i]);
            res = min({res, diff, abs(1440-diff)});
        }
        return res;
    }
    int get_diff(string s1, string s2){
        // s1 < s2
        int h1 = stoi(s1.substr(0,2));
        int h2 = stoi(s2.substr(0,2));
        int m1 = stoi(s1.substr(3,2));
        int m2 = stoi(s2.substr(3,2));
        return abs((h2-h1)*60 + (m2-m1));
    }
};
```
