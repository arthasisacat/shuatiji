# 961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array
[leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-repeated-element-in-size-2n-array/)

**difficulty(1-5)** 
2

**notes**   

## Description
In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.

Return the element repeated N times.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: [2,1,2,5,3,2]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
Output: 5
 

Note:

4 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] < 10000
A.length is even

## Solution 1
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int repeatedNTimes(vector<int>& A) {
        for (int i = 2; i < A.size(); i++) {
            /* if A[i] != A[i-1] && A[i] != A[i-2], then it must be the case that it's
            [x, y, z, x] or [x, x, y, z] return the first x which is A[0]
            */
            if (A[i] == A[i-1] || A[i] == A[i-2]) {
                return A[i];
            }
        }
        return A[0];
    }
};
```
## Solution 2: for fun!
see [https://leetcode.com/problems/n-repeated-element-in-size-2n-array/discuss/208563/JavaC%2B%2BPython-O(1)-Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-repeated-element-in-size-2n-array/discuss/208563/JavaC%2B%2BPython-O(1)-Solution) for more detail.

This is a solution just for fun, not for interview.
Instead of compare from left to right,
we can compare in random order.

Random pick two numbers.
Return if same.

50% to get the right number.
Each turn, 25% to get two right numbers.
Return the result in average 4 turns.
Time complexity O(4), space O(1)

```c++
    int repeatedNTimes(vector<int>& A) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, n = A.size();
        while (i == j || A[i] != A[j])
            i = rand() % n, j = rand() % n;
        return A[i];
    }
```
