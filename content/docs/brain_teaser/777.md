## Description

In a string composed of 'L', 'R', and 'X' characters, like "RXXLRXRXL", a move consists of either replacing one occurrence of "XL" with "LX", or replacing one occurrence of "RX" with "XR". Given the starting string start and the ending string end, return True if and only if there exists a sequence of moves to transform one string to the other.

Example:

Input: start = "RXXLRXRXL", end = "XRLXXRRLX"
Output: True
Explanation:
We can transform start to end following these steps:
RXXLRXRXL ->
XRXLRXRXL ->
XRLXRXRXL ->
XRLXXRRXL ->
XRLXXRRLX
 

Constraints:

1 <= len(start) == len(end) <= 10000.
Both start and end will only consist of characters in {'L', 'R', 'X'}.

## Solution: O(n)

LX => XL

XR => RX

**key**     If we ignore all X, relative order (and also the amount) of L and R should be the same between two strings.

by now pointers to start, end should always stops at 'L', or both stops at 'R'. they cannot be stopped at 'L' and 'R', or 'R' and 'L'.

Also, when it's a L in start, the index to see that 'L' must *not* be smaller than end's current 'L' index. Because this start's 'L' can only be moving to left, if not standing still, then this 'L' cannot become end's 'L'. thus return false. 

Same thing for R in start. The index to see 'R' in start must *not* be bigger than end's current 'R', because start's 'R' cannot move to right side.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canTransform(string start, string end) {
        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
        int n1 = start.length(), n2 = end.length();
        while (p1 < n1 || p2 < n2){
            while(p1 < n1 && start[p1] == 'X'){
                p1++;
            }
            while(p2 < n2 && end[p2] == 'X'){
                p2++;
            }
            if (p1 == n1 && p2 == n2){
                return true;
            }
            if (p1 == n1 || p2 == n2){
                return false;
            }
            if (start[p1] != end[p2]){
                return false;
            }
            if ((start[p1] == 'R' && p1 > p2) 
                ||(start[p1] == 'L' && p1 < p2)){
                return false;
            }
            p1++;
            p2++;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
